    "body": "> Is the idea that you're trying to prevent RPC users from having an inconsistent state\r\n\r\nFrom the description, I assumed the intent of the PR was to prevent RPCs like `getmempoolentry`, which acquire `mempool.cs` but not `cs_main`, from returning garbage or segfaulting during reorgs because `UpdateMempoolForReorg` and `InvalidateBlock` functions were apparently not acquiring `mempool.cs` while updating the mempool.\r\n\r\nBut actually it seems like in all the places where the mempool is updated, the code already has both `cs_main` and `mempool.cs` locks. So it should be perfectly safe to read the mempool while holding either of the two locks, and trying to acquire both is wasteful.\r\n\r\nSo maybe this PR is not doing what it intended to do, and instead it would be better just to add comments and fix thread safety annotations somehow. Maybe it would be possible to annotate `cs_main` and `mempool.cs` individually as shared locks needed for reading mempool data, and `cs_main`+`mempool.cs` both together as an exclusive lock needed for updating mempool data?",

It's fine to acquire locks at a broad scope, but it's scary to work with code that acquires locks in unexpected places and gives you no clue where or whether the locks are safe to move. Would suggest either moving the lock to where it is more obviously needed or commenting:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Mempool lock for ActivateBestChainStep calls below.

But this is still not clear to me. If this code locked the `mempool.cs` before calling `ActivateBestChainStep` and unlocked it immediately after it returned, would there be a bug? `ActivateBestChainStep` already updates the mempool, so if this code isn't locking to maintain the invariant that views of the mempool are consistent with chainActive, what invariant is it trying to maintain?",

(E.g. we DisconnetTip and then fail to call UpdateMempoolForReorg, because another thread acquired the lock)\r\n\r\nThanks for explaining and adding the comment. It is clear if mempool.cs needs to provide views of the mempool that are consistent with chainActive, then it needs to be locked between the first DisconnectTip call and the final UpdateMempoolForReorg call. But it would seem clearer and safer to lock the mempool right where `disconnectpool` is declared and to unlock it right after UpdateMempoolForReorg returns, instead of continuing to hold it while sending UI notifications.\r\n\r\nAlso it seems like both DisconnectTip and ConnectTip should be annotated with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main, ::mempool.cs)`, and for some reason they aren't.",
