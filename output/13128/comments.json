    "body": "Adding `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_feeEstimator)` to `processBlockTx` caused a bunch of problems in #10443 due to `cs_feeEstimator` being a private member. In [pr/fee.30](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/fee.30), `CTxMemPool::removeForBlock` would call `CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlock`, which would lock `cs_feeEstimator`, and then call a lambda passed from the caller to loop through transactions, calling `CBlockPolicyEstimator::processTx` which would call `CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlockTx`. The new annotation to added `processBlockTx` caused the compiler to error on these calls.\r\n\r\nThe errors were spurious, since `cs_feeEstimator` was locked the entire time, but because `cs_feeEstimator` was a private member of `CBlockPolicyEstimator`, there was no way to annotate the lambda asserting that `cs_feeEstimator` was locked. Making the mutex public would have solved the problem, but instead in [pr/fee.31](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/fee.31) I opted to fix the problem by hiding the `processBlockTx` call in another callback to be less invasive and simplify some other things.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to note this because some people were curious about it. I thought it was interesting because:\r\n\r\n- There can sometimes be a tension between wanting to make mutexes private, and wanting to make assertions about them in code outside the class.\r\n\r\n- There doesn't seem to be any way to annotate a `std::function` variable asserting that a mutex must always be locked before the function is called, and requiring the compiler to check this. It's possible to annotate a lambda assigned to a `std::function` variable, asserting that various mutexes are locked, but these assertions are completely unchecked and uncheckable without a way to annotate std::functions.",
