I really like this idea, it's something I've been wanting to do for a long time.\n\nHowever, I would really prefer that this be broken up into 2 steps: splitting out libbitcoinscript as a convenience library, THEN exposing it as a shared lib once that's stabilized. There are just too many issues to work wrt packaging/distribution/api/abi/etc to introduce a shared lib haphazardly. Once that's exposed, it can't be taken back.\n",

    "body": "Ack on the general intent. I'm precisely working on separating things on script and I think I'm close to find something that's ready for a PR, but so far I've been doing incremental little improvements first like #4617 #4680 #4681 #4555 #4694 and #4695 \nRight now it's pretty dirty with ugly commits and half-backed ideas, but you can get a general sense of where I'm headed here: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/script2\nI'll clean it up soon, I just wasn't ready for a PR yet.\n\nI'm making some things templated so that:\n1) The interpreter file is completely independent from core.h\n2) Maybe some people want to use the scripting language to sign other things beside bitcoin transactions?\nIn particular I would like very few things in the same file as the interpreter (in my case checksig the sig cache, and verifyscript) to make it easier to read.\n\nSo I'm not sure what I should do now...we should definitely coordinate.\nMy approach was improving script first, separating it later, then move to its own module (this PR).\nMaybe its own module first then imrpoving things like you're doing it's better.\n",

Nothing bad detected in the process, but yeah, the more people that independently verify is 1:1 the better, I'll leave that branch there in case is useful for somebody else verifying 1:1.\n\nACK\n",

I could #ifdef that part out, if y'all prefer, but I want to atleast get script things properly separated and then separate out the other crap later as possible.\n\n@sipa: In the future, I'd hope that bitcoind just uses libbitcoinscript as a static link, so it makes sense to include the exposed file. I agree that the cache flag (and others in the future) dont make any sense to expose (hell, cache isnt even built in...), so I moved that one to script.h.\n\n@petertodd I agree, do you have any ideas for names that arent ridiculously long?\n",

We've never installed headers, so that's not a one-line fix.\n\nI spent a good chunk of the day working on getting exports working properly. It was simple for Linux, but it's going to be quite complicated for windows/osx. We have no infrastructure for building shared libs there, so it's going to require a re-working of dependencies and build-scripts to get non-Linux platforms in place.\n\nOSX dylib builds, but it needed -lcrypto to link. key.cpp and script.h pull in some symbols. I'm not sure why Linux works, presumably the linker is smart enough to drop the unused paths. Windows needs a bunch of work.\n\nSo, NACK on anything but code movement until the aspects of building/distributing shared libs have been properly evaluated. I'm certainly volunteering to help get those things in order, but I don't like the idea of treating master as a feature branch.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3.

    "body": "There's much more to it for building dll's. For starters, we'll need 2 sets of dependencies and a way to cope with them (dllimport vs dllexport). We'll have to rewrite a good chunk of configure to quit assuming static linkage for mingw. After those are done, we can teach our headers how to cope with the 2 types of builds. Then we'll need some tests to verify that the dll actually does something useful.\n\nI have all of the above hacked together enough to test. They're non-trivial changes. In reality, I think time would be better spent trying to drop those dependencies for lib usage, since they're quite minimal already.\n",

Moving functions from the .cpp to the .h should not result in build errors.\n\nI'm sure what you want can be solved some other way. I wouldn't worry about size of the resulting library at all in this initial pull.\n",
