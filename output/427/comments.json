for web sites) to login\nJul 24 02:08:50 <jrmithdobbs>   but it can be used for everything from auth->sso->data channel encryption->identity verification of 3rd parties\nJul 24 02:08:52 <jrmithdobbs>

in openid+oauth land\nJul 24 02:09:25 <jrmithdobbs>   out of band\nJul 24 02:09:32 <Diablo-D3> its a part of the stack, but not part of either of those specs\nJul 24 02:09:49 <Diablo-D3> identify verification can be done with oauth, btw\nJul 24 02:09:58 <Diablo-D3> actually, it can be done with SOME openid providers too\nJul 24 02:10:24 <jrmithdobbs>   ya that's the other problem with openid/oath is every provider is slightly different in spec-breaking ways ;p\nJul 24 02:10:26 <Diablo-D3> theres at least one that, for example, offer support for shit like finger print readers and crypto dongles\nJul 24 02:10:32 <Diablo-D3> not spec breaking\nJul 24 02:10:37 <Diablo-D3> they just offer more choices\nJul 24 02:10:55 <Diablo-D3> the website using openid doesnt NEED to know whats going on\nJul 24 02:11:04 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: google has actually, several times, changed user's ticket id or whatever that is their unique identifier\nJul 24 02:11:09 <jrmithdobbs>   not joking\nJul 24 02:11:25 <jrmithdobbs>   so if you only used google as a provider for some website you'd lose your account because your identifier changed\nJul 24 02:11:28 <jrmithdobbs>   lol\nJul 24 02:11:34 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: wtf\nJul 24 02:11:51 <BlueMatt>  damn, sudo via fingerprint swipe is sexy as hell\nJul 24 02:12:03 <sacarlson> Diablo-D3: you were correct my site doesn't change the token unless the session is broken it would appear\nJul 24 02:12:06 <Diablo-D3> bluematt: pam has fucking shit for everything\nJul 24 02:12:12 <BlueMatt>  no shit\nJul 24 02:12:15 <jrmithdobbs>   i really wish i was joking, because openid/oauth are better than _nothing_ (but not as good as kerberos)\nJul 24 02:12:27 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: wtf, that site is somewhat possibly broken\nJul 24 02:12:34 <Diablo-D3> I mean, wtf google and all\nJul 24 02:12:43 <Diablo-D3> but Im not using that id\nJul 24 02:12:46 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: no google is broken, other providers have done it too\nJul 24 02:12:57 \\*   underscor has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)\nJul 24 02:13:09 <phantomcircuit>    tcatm, am i seriously going to have to use mod_rewrite just to name files trades.json\nJul 24 02:13:15 <Diablo-D3> what Im saying is, Im not using that for the internal id on my site\nJul 24 02:13:18 <BlueMatt>  now if only dmcrypt would decrypt via fingerprint scan...\nJul 24 02:13:25 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: was just an example\nJul 24 02:13:28 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, you can do that\nJul 24 02:13:33 <phantomcircuit>    it's just silly insecure\nJul 24 02:13:40 <BlueMatt>  yea, I would think so\nJul 24 02:13:41 <Diablo-D3> bluematt: dmcrypt doesnt use pam for auth\nJul 24 02:13:50 <Diablo-D3> it'd be interesting as hell if it did, though\nJul 24 02:13:56 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, sudo via fingerprint swipe is also insecure as hell\nJul 24 02:14:06 <BlueMatt>  Diablo-D3: I know, I was just wishing if it could use some kind of fingerprint scan hash for key\nJul 24 02:14:07 <jrmithdobbs>   i'm working on using OTP-ish stuff for dm_crypt key storage ;p\nJul 24 02:14:24 <phantomcircuit>    the fingerprint is stored as a hash of some data structure, but it only results in like 12 bits of entropy\nJul 24 02:14:27 <jrmithdobbs>   (technically it's challenge-response, but in a semi-onetime way)\nJul 24 02:14:28 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: still, the problem is this\nJul 24 02:14:31 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: well yea, someone can grab a scan of your print from a glass or something...\nJul 24 02:14:35 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: I do _not_ want to deploy my own auth scheme\nJul 24 02:14:38 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: thats it?\nJul 24 02:14:46 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, no you can bruteforce it trivially\nJul 24 02:14:49 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: its easy to code, its easy to secure from the electronic side\nJul 24 02:14:52 <jrmithdobbs>   Diablo-D3: internally?\nJul 24 02:14:54 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: 2**12 sounds way too small\nJul 24 02:14:58 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: yeah\nJul 24 02:15:04 <jrmithdobbs>   why wouldn't you deploy your own auth scheme?\nJul 24 02:15:05 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, lol it is\nJul 24 02:15:07 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: but its not actual authentication\nJul 24 02:15:11 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: maybe that was some old model?\nJul 24 02:15:40 <prof7bit>  fingers can be hacked easily.\nJul 24 02:15:48 <jrmithdobbs>   BlueMatt: i don't trust biometric scanners, almost all of them have ended up having HORRIBLEY simple spoofing methods\nJul 24 02:15:51 <BlueMatt>  yea, they can get a print from something you touch...\nJul 24 02:15:55 <jrmithdobbs>   BlueMatt: at least, not as a lone factor\nJul 24 02:15:56 <phantomcircuit>    BlueMatt, my T61's builtin fingerprint swipe would result in a 64 bit \"hash\" of which the first 42 bits where trivially predicted\nJul 24 02:16:11 <Diablo-D3> jrmithdobbs: I can have them put an email in, and then even send a click me auth url to the email, it still doesnt tell me who the people really are\nJul 24 02:16:14 \\*   senseles (senseless@112.202.74.41) has joined #bitcoin-dev\nJul 24 02:16:18 <phantomcircuit>    not to mention that my fingerprints where all over the thing anyways lol\nJul 24 02:16:22 <BlueMatt>  phantomcircuit: damn...again though, maybe that was an old\n",
