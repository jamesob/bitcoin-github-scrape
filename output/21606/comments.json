    "body": "@MarcoFalke Sure! Thanks for the ping!\r\n\r\nTested ACK faaf3954e2f0089b6c6b9965f15e7f9af09c6fb0\r\n\r\nFWIW I believe the code paths that this PR adds coverage for is a subset of the code paths covered by the RPC fuzzer (see #21169). That is just an observation and not an argument against this PR.\r\n\r\nI think we should strive for covering our functions _both_ 1.) from the \"micro level\" as in this case, and 2.) from the \"macro level\" as in the case of say the `process_message`, `process_messages` and `rpc` fuzzers.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n1. The macro level harnesses are more constrained and the fuzzer will thus focus its finite resources on realistic code paths which may be problematic as the code is written *today* (\"reachable\" bugs).\r\n2. The micro level harnesses give the fuzzer permission to explore also code paths which are not exercised by current callers but may be exercised in the future by future callers (_currently_ \"unreachable\" latent bugs). \r\n\r\nIn other words: Strong Concept ACK for reaching into the PSBT code from *both* the micro level (this PR) and from the macro level (RPC fuzzer, see #21169) :)\r\n",
