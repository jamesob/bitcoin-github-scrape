Since I think it was extremely\nuseful to group many related PRs under one big \"DEPENDENT\" one and coordinate how many of them are opened at the same time; at some\npoint after 0.12 is forked I will open and analogous PR to continue\nthis one. But even if I believe that `Params()` is a great example of an\napparently-hard-to-remove global, the next PR will be more generic: there's more globals to pass\ndown explicitly not just `Params()` (mempool, mapBlockIndex,\nchainActive, pindexBestHeader...). So ideally we would make this work\nper-function rather than per-global. That's also more parallelizable\nin terms of people. Explicitly passing all its variables to a\nfunction is in principle a simple task, but I think it would be a\ngood opportunity for new developers to get familiarized with the\ndevelopment process (rebases, nits, utACKs, re-utACKs, etc) while the\nchange they're doing is (while not a priority) something generally\ndesired in the long term, so they can see their PR eventually merged.\nIn any case, the main point of doing it with globals in general is\ntouching function declarations less total times to make the process\nless disruptive for other unrelated PRs.\n\nIn addition, this was never complete but as new functions are created\nin main it becomes more incomplete as time passes. Without going\nfunction by function, one that I thought only needed\nConsensus::Params, may need now the full CChainParams while I miss\nthe change in blind rebase. It is not an unsolvable problem, but it\nwould make the refactor more disruptive than needed.\n\nI will post here to link to that new DEPENDENT PR. In the meantime,\nif you were interested in this PR, you can review #7053, which is this the last part of this PR\nthat will be opened independently (apart from #6625 which is more part\nof #6382).\n",
