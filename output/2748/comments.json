    "body": "Just a generic comment: I'm strongly in favor of moving towards a real build system, but under the condition that we switch entirely. I wouldn't want to retain both the old and the new, and needing to maintain them both. So, as soon as this can be used to build on linux/linux-mingw/osx/win32, and the gitian builds work, I'm fine with merging. Perhaps @laanwj wants to retain the .pro file, but assuming the autotools plugin to Qt Creator is powerful enough, I'd rather get rid of it.\n",
