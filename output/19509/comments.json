How to better integrate it with the existing codebase? Should the format be similar to what we have now:\r\n`received: addr (30003 bytes) peer=0`? Or maybe it doesn't matter.\r\n2. Is there any threat of this feature being used for DoS? Perhaps on a system where file create is expensive, an attacker could disconnect/reconnect (from a new net address?) to make us create a new file? Maybe the file should be created after 1 minute of connection lifetime? (Although the messages from the very beginning should not be lost).",

For both debugging and learning someone should be at the keyboard and the node shouldn't be working with anything real.  Additionally, I imagine that if writing a very small amount to disk in this way (every time a message is sent or received) is a DoS vector then there are many more serious ones available.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is worth consideration, especially if we think this will one day be used for wider purposes.\r\n",

Will definitely code-review that within the next days.\r\n\r\nJust one detail I find quite odd: why create two files instead of just one and not rather include the direction as part of the serialization for each message? Is it only about saving disk space (1 byte per message) or is there another reason I'm not aware of? I've never seen a logging/sniffing tool that divides up into multiple files before and tend to think it would only complicate re-assembling the whole send/receive order later.",

Additionally the parser, being written in python, is actually noticeably slow. Forcing it to process all of the messages and then filter would be unnecessarily inconvenient.\r\n\r\nGenerally I'd say it makes sense to divide up into files/folders by criteria that I would likely use as frequent search key for accessing the logging data. Would I often want to access logs for a certain peer? Absolutely. Would I want to see _only_ incoming or outcoming messages for a certain peer? Very unlikely, as the resulting data is probably not very valueable without the whole request/response stream in both directions. On the other hand, your arguments for simplification, efficiency (if only looking for incoming _or_ outcoming messages is really such a frequent operation) and flexibility are also very strong, hence this solution is also okay with me.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the code in more detail and noticed that there may be a serialization endianness problem, see the comments soon following below.\r\n",

    "body": "Regarding mini_parser in the functional test: discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#discussion_r465770624).  The popular question is \"Why reimplement the parser here, as opposed to just calling `contrib/message-logging/message-logging-parser.py`?\"\r\n\r\nThe main reason, which I agree with, is brought up by @jnewbery.  \r\n\r\n> I think it's much better not to assume that the contrib directory is available. Functional tests can be run when the build directory is out of tree and the source directory is not available. It makes sense to me to have a limited parser in the test case rather than importing from somewhere else.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that this separate mini_parser makes it clear, at a glance, what exactly is being tested.  As noted in the module docstring of `p2p_message_logging.py`, the message logging parser _isn't_ tested in this test.  This test is for LogMessage only.  I would hate to run into a Hubble Space Telescope-like problem where LogMessage is wrong but the message logging parser is wrong in the same way, so the errors go by unnoticed.\r\n",

    "body": "> It pains me a bit that this circumvents the existing logging infrastructure. Why is it not the case this is all just logged to debug.log (like everything else) and the parser works on that, filtering peer messages?\r\n\r\nThis PR dumps binary serialized messages (not text) to file, which is then post-processed by other software. The msgs_*.dat files can be enormous - hundreds of megabytes if blocks are being sent over that connection. Converting those messages to printable text and dropping them into the debug.log file would make them larger still, overwhelm the standard debug logging (eg a block message converted to hex would be millions of characters), and probably be a performance bottleneck (since all messages logged to debug.log would need to be deserialized and passed through tinyformat.h).\r\n\r\nI think this also answers your other questions:\r\n\r\n> I don't think \".dat\" is the right extension. These are logs, not data, and should end in \".log\".\r\n\r\n`.log` to me suggests printable text log files. These are binary files that need post-processing before they're readable.",

This functionality is super useful for 1.) learning purposes, 2.) troubleshooting purposes, and 3.) fuzzing purposes (easy generation of seed corpora from actual message data).\r\n\r\nI encourage others to review. To try this out:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gh checkout pr 19509 && make distclean && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-incompatible-bdb && make\r\n$ src/bitcoind -capturemessages\r\n# now look in ~/.bitcoin/message_capture/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe availability of easy-to-use built-in tools such as this and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` which allow for easy debugging/inspection of the P2P layer of Bitcoin Core will make the road to P2P understanding so much easier/quicker for future generations of Bitcoin Core contributions.

    "body": "`git range-diff master 2418ec6 4690881`\r\n\r\n* Fixed version fRelay bug\r\n  * The parser now more closely matches how parsing works in the test framework and in bitcoind\r\n* Documentation now follows PEP 0394\r\n* Removed cat overuse in documentation\r\n\r\nFirst of all, many thanks @theStack for both finding the bug and identifying exactly what causes it.  Your guess was spot on and the links to the BIPs were very useful!  It ended up identifying a small bug with how I implemented my message parser.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure what to think about this message.  Looking at it closely, it has the following:\r\n\r\n* Version = 60000\r\n* fRelay = 0 (1 byte)\r\n* Declared payload size = 107\r\n* Actual payload size = 107\r\n\r\nThe fRelay field is only supposed to exist as of version 70001.  So this message is malformed.  But, in the protocol's implementation in bitcoind, we don't check this.\r\n\r\nThis is a discrepancy between our testing framework and bitcoind.  If fRelay was 1 for a message with version <70001, bitcoind would take it as a 1, whereas our testing framework would take it was a 0.  I don't think this will ever happen in the real world, but it's worth noting.  I've opened a PR to discuss this as #20411.\r\n\r\nFor now I take this as fixed.",

    "body": "> Slightly less sure about separating send/receive, but seems ok.\r\n\r\nThis was my suggestion. Maybe a hangover from my telecoms days when it was common to dump different streams for send/recv. The benefit here is that we save one bit (really one byte since there's nowhere to stuff it in the other metadata fields) per message because we don't need a flag to indicate send/recv. As well as that, there are probably at least some tools/analyses that are only interested in traffic in one direction. Splitting the files means that those tools would not have to read/filter/seek over a bunch of messages that they're not interested in.\r\n\r\n> I wonder if we shouldn't go further actually. Having one file (or two) = one session would be pretty nice for certain analyses. That could be accomplished by adding e.g. (our own node startup time, peer id) or (connection start time) in the filenames (or directory names).\r\n\r\nACK! I think a directory structure of `<IP_port>/<peerid>/[send|recv].dev` would work very nicely.\r\n\r\n> I'm slightly concerned about the overhead of opening/closing files for every message sent/received. Has anyone benchmarked this (or have ideas for a useful benchmark, even)? I understand the rationale of not occupying a large part of the file descriptor space for this, but it'd be good to know it doesn't really hurt.\r\n\r\nThis is something that @troygiorshev and I discussed at length, but I can't find that discussion in this PR, so it was probably before it was opened. Troy, do you have any notes from then? I know you looked into both alternatives.",

    "body": "@jnewbery \r\n\r\n> The benefit here is that we save one bit (really one byte since there's nowhere to stuff it in the other metadata fields) per message because we don't need a flag to indicate send/recv.\r\n\r\nThe direction could be stored in the top bit of the size field. The max protocol message size is 4000000 bytes, so even 3 bytes would be enough if we really wanted to. A variable-length encoding of command name (1 length byte + that many bytes for the command name itself e.g.) would also save several bytes on average per message.\r\n\r\nI don't think dump size is that much of a priority that it warrants lots of extra effort, but I also don't think the size argument on itself is a good reason for splitting the files based on direction.\r\n\r\n> As well as that, there are probably at least some tools/analyses that are only interested in traffic in one direction. Splitting the files means that those tools would not have to read/filter/seek over a bunch of messages that they're not interested in.\r\n\r\nMaybe, but I expect those to also be interested in just one or a few commands, and they'll still need to read/filter/seek over the ones they don't care about. On the other hand, anything analyzing query/response like things will need to look in both files too.\r\n\r\nEspecially if we'd go in a direction of separating separate sessions to the same ip/port, I think there is an elegance to having exactly 1 file = 1 session.\r\n\r\nAnother idea: would it make sense to store the version information of the dumping node (CLIENT_NAME, CLIENT_VERSION, perhaps also connection type)? Either in a header at the beginning of the file, or in the filename. That would make it easy to do analyses to compare behavior of different client versions.\r\n\r\nWhat about a directory structure of `<CLIENT_NAME>_<CLIENT_VERSION>/<ip>_<port>/<timestamp>_<peerid>.dat`?\r\n",

    "body": "> why not capture messages after CNode::ReceiveMsgBytes?\r\n\r\nThis has been brought up a couple times now, and it's a great question, so it's worth a full response (that won't be buried in resolved conversations).\r\n\r\nMy priority in this PR is that the capture of messages always occurs in order from an _application layer_ perspective.  Because of this, I have to capture messages in the MessageHandler thread.\r\n\r\nIf I were to instead capture incoming messages in the SocketHandler thread, say, right after ReceiveMsgBytes, the following could possibly occur:\r\n\r\n* receive and capture message X\r\n* receive and capture message Y\r\n* send and capture message A\r\n\r\nwhereas on the processing side (since X and Y are in in the `vRecvMsg` queue before being processed), the node actually did the following:\r\n\r\n* process message X\r\n* respond with message A\r\n* process message Y\r\n\r\nSo the order would be broken.  Remember, this PR isn't just a fun replacement for wireshark.  The point is that someone improving/debugging/learning bitcoin's p2p protocol can see what's actually going on from the node's perspective, without having to worry about how the timing of the queues is complicating things.",

I was thinking that the difference between net-level and net_processing-level ordering would only be different interleaving across peers, but you're right to point out it even obscures the processing within one peer. I agree it's valuable to dump in processing order.\r\n",

In the parsing script you assume both time and data size are stored in little endian, hence this needs to be enforced here. I think `ser_writedata32` (see `serialization.h`) can be used for this.\r\nIt's a pity though that the CI tests don't fail, I think this is because we don't have any testing instance where the architecture uses big endian byte order :/",

The comment above says \"so that the handshake occurs\", but this doesn't clarify anything for me. do you mean the version handshake? why do we need to disconnect for the version handshake to occur?\r\n\r\nmy understanding of this test is that it parses through the sent & received data files to check the structure of each recorded message is valid. I added some logging to see what message types are recorded & from what I can tell its the same whether or not we disconnect. am I missing something? ",

It answers the simple question: \"Can I see what messages my node is sending and receiving?\"\n+\n+## Usage and Functionality\n+\n+* Run `bitcoind` with the `-capturemessages` option.\n+* Look in the `message_capture` folder in your datadir.\n+  * Typically this will be `~/.bitcoin/message_capture`.\n+  * See that there are many folders inside, one for each peer names with its IP address and port.\n+  * Inside each peer's folder there are two `.dat` files: one is for received messages (`msgs_recv.dat`) and the other is for sent messages (`msgs_sent.dat`).\n+* Run `contrib/message-capture/message-capture-parser.py` with the proper arguments.\n+  * See the `-h` option for help.\n+  * To see all messages, both sent and received, for all peers use:\n+    ```\n+    ./contrib/message-capture/message-capture-parser.py -o out.json \\\n+    ~/.bitcoin/message_capture/**/*.dat\n+    ```\n+  * Note:  The messages in the given `.dat` files will be interleaved in chronological order.  So, giving both received and sent `.dat` files (as above with `*.dat`) will result in all messages being interleaved in chronological order.\n+  * If an output file is not provided (i.e. the `-o` option is not used), then the output prints to `stdout`.\n+* View the resulting output.\n+  * The output file is `JSON` formatted.\n+  * Suggestion: use `jq` to view the output, with `jq out.json`",

This would be faster, lower memory (especially when analyzing lots of dumps), and support streaming.",

It answers the simple question: \"Can I see what messages my node is sending and receiving?\"\n+\n+## Usage and Functionality\n+\n+* Run `bitcoind` with the `-capturemessages` option.\n+* Look in the `message_capture` folder in your datadir.\n+  * Typically this will be `~/.bitcoin/message_capture`.\n+  * See that there are many folders inside, one for each peer names with its IP address and port.\n+  * Inside each peer's folder there are two `.dat` files: one is for received messages (`msgs_recv.dat`) and the other is for sent messages (`msgs_sent.dat`).\n+* Run `contrib/message-capture/message-capture-parser.py` with the proper arguments.\n+  * See the `-h` option for help.\n+  * To see all messages, both sent and received, for all peers use:\n+    ```\n+    ./contrib/message-capture/message-capture-parser.py -o out.json \\\n+    ~/.bitcoin/message_capture/**/*.dat\n+    ```\n+  * Note:  The messages in the given `.dat` files will be interleaved in chronological order.  So, giving both received and sent `.dat` files (as above with `*.dat`) will result in all messages being interleaved in chronological order.\n+  * If an output file is not provided (i.e. the `-o` option is not used), then the output prints to `stdout`.\n+* View the resulting output.\n+  * The output file is `JSON` formatted.\n+  * Suggestion: use `jq` to view the output, with `jq out.json`",
