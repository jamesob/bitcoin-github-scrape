    "body": "Nice!\n\nRe: ordering: I'm not an accountant, but I'm a bit in doubt about doing this on the GUI side and computing them, based on date and time, on the fly. It seems like that if there is no permanence and ie changes in ordering can change the displayed balances.\n\nAfter all, bitcoin transactions on lowest level have not date and time associated with them, the date and time shown is either A) when it was received by your client B) the corresponding block time/date, if confirmed. The former can change arbitrarily (ie through a rescan/salvagewallet), the second cannot except through chain reorganizations which are rare. \n\nOf course, transactions in the block chain do have a normative ordering, ie by (block number,tx number). This roughly corresponds to time. You could also use the block timestamps. Note that block timestamps are not monotonically increasing, so these two are not always the same.\n\nMaybe use that (block,tx number) order, and not display a counting balance for unconfirmed transactions?\n",

I think this drives home the idea that the running balances should be the balance as of the time that transaction existed, irrespective of any sorting and filtering.\n\nIf we agreed against that point, it may slightly simplify things, as we wouldn't need to clone the transaction cache into a pointer list to sort by time and calculate balances. Instead, we could iterate the transaction model index, how they are currently sorted and filtered, using that existing list, then calculate balances.\n\nEdit: Currently, we have the ability to filter out any transaction records, that for example, have less than a 0.01 BTC balance. If we worked off the sorted/filtered list, I don't know if we'd still have that ability.\n",

    "body": "IMO this is most useful if the running balances are of the time the transaction was mined into the chain, and are thus static (excluding reorganizations of the chain).\n\nYou can also use this for optimization, as the value for transactions deeper in the chain will not change - barring catastrophic chain reorganization, which would be fair to trigger a full recompute.\n\nChanges to sorting and filtering should certainly not affect them, that's visual only. Hence my reservations of doing this in the GUI in the first place. You can still do it in the GUI code, but be sure that trivial changes to user preferences (ie, filtering/sorting) don't affect it.\n\nThinking of it, transactions also have an 'nOrderPos' which is another ordering that could be used. It is the order in which transaction were added to the wallet. This is preferable to using time and date, but less stable than (height,tx) block chain ordering, as it is affected by when the unconfirmed transaction is first received by the client (so eg -salvagewallet will reconstruct in a different order).\n",
