    "body": "> I understand why you'd want to pass by ref, but there's no benefit to passing by rvalue. This code suggests to me that SelectNodeToEvict() is going to keep ownership of vEvictionCandidates and you're using move semantics to avoid a copy, but that's not actually happening here.\r\n\r\nI've now reverted to the original version (alternative 1 below), since [your suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20477#discussion_r537411893) and [sipa's suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19972#discussion_r517734066) are mutually exclusive :)\r\n\r\nI'll let others chime in regarding the choice between the three alternatives:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAlternative 1. Optional<NodeId> SelectNodeToEvict(std::vector<NodeEvictionCandidate>)\r\nAlternative 2. Optional<NodeId> SelectNodeToEvict(std::vector<NodeEvictionCandidate>&)\r\nAlternative 3. Optional<NodeId> SelectNodeToEvict(std::vector<NodeEvictionCandidate>&&)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrying to summarize the pros/cons:\r\n* Alternative 1. Simple and no gotchas. Does an extraneous copy.\r\n* Alternative 2. No extraneous copy. Possibly surprising that a function named `SelectNodeToEvict` modifies its input.\r\n* Alternative 3. No extraneous copy. Risk of accidental use-after-moved-from in the future. Possibly confusing (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20477#discussion_r537411893).\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the members of the review club could chime in. Some questions for the review club: Do you agree with the pros/cons of each alternative? Which alternative do you find easier to review? Which alternative do you prefer? Is it possible to quantify the real-world impact of the extraneous copy in a theoretical worst-case scenario?",

    "body": "> since your suggestion and sipa's suggestion are mutually exclusive :)\r\n\r\nI don't think they are mutually exclusive. There are two questions here:\r\n\r\n1. Should the argument be passed by value or by reference?\r\n2. If passed by reference, should it be passed by lvalue reference or rvalue reference?\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any disagreement about (1). We should pass by reference to avoid a copy.\r\n\r\nFor (2), I think it's slightly odd to pass by rvalue reference when it's not necessary to do so, but that's more of a stylistic thing. I see now that you're calling the function with a prvalue in the tests, which means you can't pass by lvalue reference. My preference would therefore be to revert to what you had before.",

    "body": "I'm a HUGE supporter of the early return pattern (AKA bouncer pattern) that you're using here.

Maybe (maybe...) `EVICTION_THRESHOLD` and `NON_EVICTION_THRESHOLD` and put the fact that it's inclusive on both ends in the comments?  Or follow the half-open convention of \"lower bounds are inclusive, upper bounds are exclusive\". Popular in Python, not sure about C++.\r\n\r\nAll of this said, why have the early return at all?  All of the tests below check for non-eviction.  Can't we run them regardless of the number of nodes?\r\n\r\n(Feel free to reword my code comments)",

    "body": "From PR Review club:\r\n\r\n**Q: Why is eviction guaranteed if we have at least 29 eviction candidates?**\r\n\r\nThe code in net.cpp (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabecce/src/net.cpp#L954-L968) protects at most 28 peers from eviction (4 by net group, 8 by lowest ping time, 4 by last time of novel tx, up to 8 non-tx-relay peers by last novel block time, and 4 more peers by last novel block time). So any additional peers are guaranteed to be candidates for eviction.\r\n\r\n**Q: Why is non-eviction guaranteed if we have no more than 20 eviction candidates? Is 20 the highest number of nodes that guarantees non-eviction?**\r\n\r\nThe protection at [net.cpp::961](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabecce/src/net.cpp#L961) for up to 8 non-tx-relay peers may, or may not apply to the randomly generated eviction candidates since `!n.fRelayTxes && n.fRelevantServices` will evaluate to `randbool`. So we cannot count them in the _guaranteed_ non-eviction? \r\n\r\nSo, guaranteed non-eviction is only on 4(CompareNetGroupKeyed) + 8(ReverseCompareNodeMinPingTime) + 4(CompareNodeTXTime) + 4(CompareNodeBlockTime) = 20.",
