    "body": "My pull was derived from building bitcoin and bitcoin-qt on a newly installed Snow Leopard hackintosh in Virtualbox. I did not download the `Qt Mac OS X SDK`. What worked for me was downloading Xcode 3.2 (the latest version I could find for Snow Leopard)  and \"sudo port install qt4-mac\". Perhaps the readme for Mac OS X should be split into OS X 64 bit and OS X 32 bit instructions? (It seems much easier to virtualize the 32 bit Mac OS X).\n![capture3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4390399/486966/29ec2a0c-b943-11e2-9900-f3430421a026.png)\n",

Because the SDK downloadable from qt-project does not work out of the box (i always had to compile qt sdk) i would also say, remove the parts of Line 47 and change it with your information (install through port).
