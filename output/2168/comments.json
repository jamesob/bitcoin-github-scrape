    "body": "The only thing keeping history is necessary for, is bootstrapping fully validating nodes. However, that doesn't require an index (or even a Bitcoin node at all - it could be provided by an HTTP-based file service or other protocols - something that web has plenty of). I'm sure that making a feature available on the P2P will result in infrastructure depending on it, something that would burden the nodes that provide archive data. Yes, making it an optional feature makes this much less of a problem, but I still prefer to be conservative with functions the P2P network provides unless there is a very clear use.\n\nAs far as I know, all versions before 0.7.0 maintained a full tx-to-diskpos index, and there was no way at all to query it (not even RPC). I'm quite sure this was a deliberate choice by Satoshi. In a mail about maintaining per-txout spendability of wallet transactions, he clearly said not to rely on the txindex for this, as it wouldn't always be available.\n\nEDIT: I dislike this feature as whole (even as RPC), as I think that services that are built not to depend on infinite history have better scalability. It's extremely useful for debugging though, so I added it. I'm sure people will use it for other purposes as well, and that's clearly preferable to having them depend on a centralized service for it. Providing it via P2P doesn't add much to that, IMHO.\n",

For not-fully spent confirmed transactions, it may be slower than with txindex present. In general, without txindex I consider getrawtransaction to just work on a best-effort basis.\n- extra disk space caused by txindex will be in the blktree/ directory\n\nOtherwise the plan looks correct and complete to me.\n\nEDIT: -reindex doesn't cause a slow startup, the startup is always instant, but importing (and thus building the txindex) happens in the background.\n",
