The reason NDEBUG builds are not allowed is that some of the `assert` conditions had side effects (#3344)\r\n\r\nPerhaps it'd be a good idea to document this in the developer notes.\r\n\r\nShould `Assume()` log to debug log (perhaps in a category) if hit in in non-debug build?

    "body": "Excellent questions!\r\n\r\n* What's the long-term plan for assert?\r\n\r\n`assert` and `Assert` do almost the exact same thing and they can be used interchangeably, as long as the code compiles.\r\n\r\nExisting asserts should not be replaced with `Assume`, because asserts documents *fatal* checks. For example, the program should not continue when running into UB. (`Assert(pindex)->nHeight` can not continue if the assert fails, so `Assume` would be inappropriate).\r\n\r\n* Is it ok for Assert/Assume condition to have side effects?\r\n\r\nYes, I'd say so. I can't imagine anyone would want to run with asserts disabled, even if none of them had side-effects. For example, the consensus code uses asserts to catch internal logic errors. With those disabled, you might run out of consensus without noticing.\r\n\r\n* Perhaps it'd be a good idea to document this in the developer notes.\r\n\r\nWill look into this.\r\n\r\n* Should Assume() log to debug log (perhaps in a category) if hit in in non-debug build? It means there's a logic bug which should be reported and fixed.\r\n\r\nCorrect, there is likely a *non-fatal* logic bug which should be reported. Though, care should be taken to not turn it into a *fatal* one. E.g. a remote peer could trigger the `Assume` and cause an out-of-disk error by writing to the debug log. Also, we should take care to not induce anxiety into users when they hit a non-fatal issue, that generally doesn't affect node operation. A specific debug log category for this could make sense, but I'll leave that for a follow up.",
