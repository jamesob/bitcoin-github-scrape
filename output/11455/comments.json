    "body": "Indeed, if there were an invariant in mempool that everything paid at least GetMinFee we'd already violate this (temporarily) in cases where mempool has been limited and we're mid-reorg, and more often when there are dependencies which result in something having a higher limit-enforced fee.\r\n\r\nStill, I'd kinda prefer the original other option where the minRelayTxFee is used directly in getmempoolinfo instead of GetMinFee, in part because it breaks the wallet fee estimation \"reason\" value (see wallet/fees.cpp:69, which can no longer ever be hit in the fee estimation case as MEMPOOL_MIN will always be set, not a huge deal, but nice to not change that IMO)",
