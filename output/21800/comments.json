    "body": "@ariard thanks for the review, I'm very much looking forward to the IRC discussions to better understand what packages we want to support. In your domino bumping example, I'm not entirely sure why we couldn't use several packages of size 2 to bump them?\r\n\r\n> MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT to 2 transactions for the initial deployement of package-relay\r\n\r\nWe're still a few PRs from package accept with submission to mempool - will put some things up soon - and then a few PRs from package relay but sounds good to me. I personally believe that the P2P requirements can be more stringent than individual transaction mempool policy - I also think it's fine for peers to negotiate their maximum package size they're willing to receive in a `SENDPACKAGES` message. Starting with a default of 2 sounds good to me. However, I don't think package ancestor/descendant limits should be explicitly less than individual ones within a node, because I think it could give an adversary the chance to prevent a package from being accepted by submitting a very large descendant to the top transaction.\r\n\r\n> implementing \"intersection-dedup\" evaluation, where duplicated ancestors/descendants aren't accounted for package limits ?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand, could you elaborate? The `setAncestors` used in `CalculateMemPoolAncestors()` is not duplicated between transactions. I am working on a branch to \"trim\" packages when it overlaps with mempool (i.e. one or more transactions are already in the mempool), and will add test cases for ancestor/descendant limits with it.\r\n\r\n(Recent push addresses inline review comments)",

The current test has 24 transactions in the mempool and 2 in the package, so if you reduced the mempool transactions, it's 23+2 which is within limits. That's why the test would fail.

I've pushed a fix for what I expect is the culprit - single transaction ancestor/descendant limits can sometimes be slightly looser due to CPFP carve out; the decision to not return any tx results here would have caused that crash. I've gated `CheckPackageLimits()` to only run when there's more than one transaction.",

    "body": "@darosior good point. I agree sigop limits should be properly enforced for packages. At the moment, since the sigops limit is checked in `PreChecks` as you said, the limit is essentially `MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIGOPS_COST` * `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT`, or 25x the single transaction size. Should that be changed?\r\n\r\nFor `CheckPackageLimits`, I'm not sure that sigops are relevant for mempool DoS protections. We mostly care about the serialized transaction size because we don't want really large transactions to exhaust space in our mempool and we care about feerates. But we don't verify signatures after a transaction has been added to the mempool or removed from it, and don't need to know how many sigops are in our ancestors/descendants, so sigop limits probably don't make a difference?",

This set should be composed of Tx_A and Tx_B only.\r\n\r\nIn `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits`, `totalSizeWithAncestors` is the union Tx_A and Tx_B and its sum of 60 KvB is inferior to 101 KvB. After Tx_C and Tx_D are added to the mempool, the chain of transactions ABCD is of the sum 120 KvB.\r\n\r\nFurther, I don't think it's rejected by the check against `limitDescendantSize`, as Tx_A and Tx_B are evaluated independently, and not as a single cluster as they should be (Tx_A + Tx_C + Tx_D or Tx_B + Tx_C + Tx_D)\r\n\r\nNote, you need to replace Tx by chain of transactions because of `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` but I think this reasoning holds ?",

So we have A+B+C+D  and the check against `limitAncestorSize` rejects the package. Maybe the variable could be renamed `packageSizeWithAncestors`, but that's a nit.",

    "body": "Ideally yes, carve-out don't scale for multi-party (n > 2) fee-bumping.\r\n\r\nThough extending the carve-out to safely chain CPFPs was argued by Matt on the LDK side (see here https://lightningdevkit.slack.com/archives/CTBLT3CAU/p1625786787422100). Personally, I think this approach is a bit doomed as we can assume first-stage of the CPFP-chain can always be replaced by a valid claim of a counterparty, thus downgrading the feerate of your other broadcasted commitments and I prefer the concurrent domino fee-bumping approach even if it's more complexity swallowed by the LN backend.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think there is another multi-party contract issue we have to solve. Namely, the first-stage state transaction can be symmetric but the second-stage states asymmetric-though-composable. E.g a CTV tree with a root transaction with branch A/branch B spending 2 isolated outputs. Alice broadcast root+branch A and Bob broadcast root+branch B, thus accidentally or maliciously evicting Alice's branch. I think we would like the mempool logic to aggregate those in-flight packages by conserving the highest-feerate subgraphs and that would require some form of carve-out to avoid package limits interfering ?",
