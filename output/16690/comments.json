(#16339)\n+\n New RPCs\n --------\n \n - `getbalances` returns an object with all balances (`mine`,\n   `untrusted_pending` and `immature`). Please refer to the RPC help of\n   `getbalances` for details. The new RPC is intended to replace\n-  `getunconfirmedbalance` and the balance fields in `getwalletinfo`, as well as\n-  `getbalance`. The old calls may be removed in a future version.\n+  `getbalance`, `getunconfirmedbalance`, and the balance fields in\n+  `getwalletinfo`.  These old calls and fields may be removed in a\n+  future version. (#15930, #16239)\n+\n+- `setwalletflag` sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable\n+  features specific to that existing wallet, such as the new\n+  `avoid_reuse` feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockfilter` gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This\n+  RPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the\n+  `-blockfilterindex` configuration option. (#14121)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- `-blockfilterindex` enables the creation of BIP158 block filters for\n+  the entire blockchain.  Filters will be created in the background and\n+  currently use about 4 GiB of space.  Note: this version of Bitcoin\n+  Core does not serve block filters over the P2P network, although the\n+  local user may obtain block filters using the `getblockfilter` RPC.\n+  (#14121)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- `whitebind` and `whitelist` now accept a list of permissions to\n+  provide peers connecting using the indicated interfaces or IP\n+  addresses.  If no permissions are specified with an address or CIDR\n+  network, the implicit default permissions are the same as previous\n+  releases.  See the `bitcoind -help` output for these two options for\n+  details about the available permissions. (#16248)\n \n Updated RPCs\n ------------\n \n Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the\n Low-level Changes section below.\n \n-- The `sendmany` RPC had an argument `minconf` that was not well specified and\n-  would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's coin selection would succeed.\n-  The `sendtoaddress` RPC never had this check, so to normalize the behavior,\n-  `minconf` is now ignored in `sendmany`. If the coin selection does not\n-  succeed due to missing coins, it will still throw an RPC error. Be reminded\n-  that coin selection is influenced by the `-spendzeroconfchange`,\n-  `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains`\n-  command line arguments.\n+- `sendmany` no longer has a `minconf` argument.  This argument was not\n+  well specified and would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's\n+  coin selection succeeded.  Users who want to influence coin selection\n+  can use the existing `-spendzeroconfchange`, `-limitancestorcount`,\n+  `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains` configuration\n+  arguments. (#15596)\n+\n+- `getbalance` and `sendtoaddress`, plus the new RPCs `getbalances` and\n+  `createwallet`, now accept an \"avoid_reuse\" parameter that controls\n+  whether already used addresses should be included in the operation.\n+  Additionally, `sendtoaddress` will avoid partial spends when\n+  `avoid_reuse` is enabled even if this feature is not already enabled\n+  via the `-avoidpartialspends` command line flag because not doing so\n+  would risk using up the \"wrong\" UTXO for an address reuse case.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now returns a \"reused\" bool for each output if the\n+  wallet flag \"avoid_reuse\" is enabled. (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockstats` now uses BlockUndo data instead of the transaction\n+  index, making it much faster, no longer dependent on the `-txindex`\n+  configuration option, and functional for all non-pruned blocks.\n+  (#14802)\n+\n+- `utxoupdatepsbt` now accepts a `descriptors` parameter that will fill\n+  out input and output scripts and keys when known. P2SH-witness inputs\n+  will be filled in from the UTXO set when a descriptor is provided that\n+  shows they're spending segwit outputs.  See the RPC help text for full\n+  details. (#15427)\n+\n+- `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` no longer accept a\n+  `allowhighfees` parameter to fail mempool acceptance if the\n+  transaction fee exceedes the value of the configuration option\n+  `-maxtxfee`.  Now there is a hardcoded default maximum feerate that\n+  can be changed when calling either RPC using a `maxfeerate` parameter.\n+  (#15620)\n+\n+- `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, and\n+  `getrawmempool` no longer return a `size` field unless the\n+  configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=size` is used.  Instead a new\n+  `vsize` field is returned with the transaction's virtual size\n+  (consistent with other RPCs such as `getrawtransaction`). (#15637)\n+\n+- `getwalletinfo` now includes a `scanning` field that is either `false`\n+  (no scanning) or an object with information about the duration and\n+  progress of the wallet's scanning historical blocks for transactions\n+  affecting its balances. (#15730)\n+\n+- `createwallet` accepts a new `passphrase` parameter.  If set, this\n+  will create the new wallet encrypted with the given passphrase.  If\n+  unset or empty (the default), a warning will be printed and no\n+  encryption will be used. (#16394)\n+\n+- `getmempoolentry` now provides a `weight` field containing the\n+  transaction weight as defined in BIP141. (#16647)\n+\n+- `getdescriptorinfo` now returns an additional `checksum` field\n+  containing the checksum for the unmodified descriptor provided by the\n+  user (that is, before the descriptor is normalized for the\n+  `descriptor` field). (#15986)\n+\n+- `walletcreatefundedpsbt` now signals BIP125 Replace-by-Fee if the\n+  `-walletrbf` configuration option is set to true. (#15911)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- Provides bech32 addresses by default.  The user may change the address\n+  during invoice generation using a GUI toggle, or the default address\n+  type may be changed by the `-addresstype` configuration option.\n+  (#15711, #16497)\n+\n+Deprecated or removed configuration options\n+-------------------------------------------\n+\n+- `-mempoolreplacement` is removed, although default node behavior\n+  remains the same.  This option previously allowed the user to prevent\n+  the node from accepting or relaying BIP125 transaction replacements.\n+  This is different from the remaining configuration option\n+  `-walletrbf`. (#16171)\n \n Deprecated or removed RPCs\n --------------------------\n \n-- The `totalFee` option of the `bumpfee` RPC has been deprecated and will be\n-  removed in 0.20.  To continue using this option start with\n-  `-deprecatedrpc=totalFee`.  See the `bumpfee` RPC help text for more details.\n+- `bumpfee` no longer accepts a `totalFee` option unless the\n+  configuration parameter `deprecatedrpc=totalFee` is specified.  This\n+  parameter will be fully removed in a subsequent release. (#15996)\n+\n+- `generate` is now removed after being deprecated in Bitcoin Core 0.18.\n+  Use the `generatetoaddress` RPC instead. (#15492)\n+\n+P2P changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- BIP 61 reject messages were deprecated in v0.18. They are now disabled\n+  by default, but can be enabled by setting the `-enablebip61` command\n+  line option.  BIP 61 reject messages will be removed entirely in a\n+  future version of Bitcoin Core. (#14054)\n+\n+- The default value for the `-peerbloomfilters` configuration option\n+  (and, thus, BIP37/BIP111 NODE_BLOOM support) has been changed to false.\n+  This eliminates well-known DoS vectors in Bitcoin Core, especially for\n+  nodes with spinning disks. Other software should still be able to\n+  connect to older versions of Bitcoin Core and users who have manually\n+  enabled NODE_BLOOM support for the near future, but developers of such\n+  software should consider migrating to an alternative over the coming\n+  years.

Other software should still be able to\n+  connect to older versions of Bitcoin Core and users who have manually\n+  enabled NODE_BLOOM support for the near future, but developers of such\n+  software should consider migrating to an alternative over the coming\n+  years.

For privacy, BIP37 needs to be over a secure private link (e.g. authenticated and encrypted), and if you have that, you can just run the wallet RPCs for even higher efficiency than BIP37 with minimal false positives.  Your pruning argument doesn't make sense to me (BIP37 needs full blocks, so it has problems with pruning that BIP158 doesn't---with BIP158, you can create the block filter and then throw away the full block and undo data); if you're thinking about Electrum-style indexes or Electrum Personal Server rescanning, BIP37 seems equivalent in problems related to pruning).  This is probably off-topic for release notes discussion, though, so DM me on IRC or poke me in #bitcoin if you're bored and want to debate it.  :-)",

These old calls and fields may be removed in a\n+  future version. (#15930, #16239)\n+\n+- `setwalletflag` sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable\n+  features specific to that existing wallet, such as the new\n+  `avoid_reuse` feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockfilter` gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This\n+  RPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the\n+  `-blockfilterindex` configuration option. (#14121)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- `-blockfilterindex` enables the creation of BIP158 block filters for\n+  the entire blockchain.  Filters will be created in the background and\n+  currently use about 4 GiB of space.  Note: this version of Bitcoin\n+  Core does not serve block filters over the P2P network, although the\n+  local user may obtain block filters using the `getblockfilter` RPC.\n+  (#14121)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- `whitebind` and `whitelist` now accept a list of permissions to\n+  provide peers connecting using the indicated interfaces or IP\n+  addresses.  If no permissions are specified with an address or CIDR\n+  network, the implicit default permissions are the same as previous\n+  releases.  See the `bitcoind -help` output for these two options for\n+  details about the available permissions. (#16248)\n \n Updated RPCs\n ------------\n \n Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the\n Low-level Changes section below.\n \n-- The `sendmany` RPC had an argument `minconf` that was not well specified and\n-  would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's coin selection would succeed.\n-  The `sendtoaddress` RPC never had this check, so to normalize the behavior,\n-  `minconf` is now ignored in `sendmany`. If the coin selection does not\n-  succeed due to missing coins, it will still throw an RPC error. Be reminded\n-  that coin selection is influenced by the `-spendzeroconfchange`,\n-  `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains`\n-  command line arguments.\n+- `sendmany` no longer has a `minconf` argument.  This argument was not\n+  well specified and would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's\n+  coin selection succeeded.  Users who want to influence coin selection\n+  can use the existing `-spendzeroconfchange`, `-limitancestorcount`,\n+  `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains` configuration\n+  arguments. (#15596)\n+\n+- `getbalance` and `sendtoaddress`, plus the new RPCs `getbalances` and\n+  `createwallet`, now accept an \"avoid_reuse\" parameter that controls\n+  whether already used addresses should be included in the operation.\n+  Additionally, `sendtoaddress` will avoid partial spends when\n+  `avoid_reuse` is enabled even if this feature is not already enabled\n+  via the `-avoidpartialspends` command line flag because not doing so\n+  would risk using up the \"wrong\" UTXO for an address reuse case.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now returns a \"reused\" bool for each output if the\n+  wallet flag \"avoid_reuse\" is enabled. (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockstats` now uses BlockUndo data instead of the transaction\n+  index, making it much faster, no longer dependent on the `-txindex`\n+  configuration option, and functional for all non-pruned blocks.\n+  (#14802)\n+\n+- `utxoupdatepsbt` now accepts a `descriptors` parameter that will fill\n+  out input and output scripts and keys when known. P2SH-witness inputs\n+  will be filled in from the UTXO set when a descriptor is provided that\n+  shows they're spending segwit outputs.  See the RPC help text for full\n+  details. (#15427)\n+\n+- `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` no longer accept a\n+  `allowhighfees` parameter to fail mempool acceptance if the\n+  transaction fee exceedes the value of the configuration option\n+  `-maxtxfee`.  Now there is a hardcoded default maximum feerate that\n+  can be changed when calling either RPC using a `maxfeerate` parameter.\n+  (#15620)\n+\n+- `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, and\n+  `getrawmempool` no longer return a `size` field unless the\n+  configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=size` is used.  Instead a new\n+  `vsize` field is returned with the transaction's virtual size\n+  (consistent with other RPCs such as `getrawtransaction`). (#15637)\n+\n+- `getwalletinfo` now includes a `scanning` field that is either `false`\n+  (no scanning) or an object with information about the duration and\n+  progress of the wallet's scanning historical blocks for transactions\n+  affecting its balances. (#15730)\n+\n+- `createwallet` accepts a new `passphrase` parameter.  If set, this\n+  will create the new wallet encrypted with the given passphrase.  If\n+  unset or empty (the default), a warning will be printed and no\n+  encryption will be used. (#16394)\n+\n+- `getmempoolentry` now provides a `weight` field containing the\n+  transaction weight as defined in BIP141. (#16647)\n+\n+- `getdescriptorinfo` now returns an additional `checksum` field\n+  containing the checksum for the unmodified descriptor provided by the\n+  user (that is, before the descriptor is normalized for the\n+  `descriptor` field). (#15986)\n+\n+- `walletcreatefundedpsbt` now signals BIP125 Replace-by-Fee if the\n+  `-walletrbf` configuration option is set to true. (#15911)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- Provides bech32 addresses by default.  The user may change the address\n+  during invoice generation using a GUI toggle, or the default address\n+  type may be changed by the `-addresstype` configuration option.\n+  (#15711, #16497)\n+\n+Deprecated or removed configuration options\n+-------------------------------------------\n+\n+- `-mempoolreplacement` is removed, although default node behavior\n+  remains the same.  This option previously allowed the user to prevent\n+  the node from accepting or relaying BIP125 transaction replacements.\n+  This is different from the remaining configuration option\n+  `-walletrbf`. (#16171)\n \n Deprecated or removed RPCs\n --------------------------\n \n-- The `totalFee` option of the `bumpfee` RPC has been deprecated and will be\n-  removed in 0.20.  To continue using this option start with\n-  `-deprecatedrpc=totalFee`.  See the `bumpfee` RPC help text for more details.\n+- `bumpfee` no longer accepts a `totalFee` option unless the\n+  configuration parameter `deprecatedrpc=totalFee` is specified.  This\n+  parameter will be fully removed in a subsequent release. (#15996)\n+\n+- `generate` is now removed after being deprecated in Bitcoin Core 0.18.\n+  Use the `generatetoaddress` RPC instead. (#15492)\n+\n+P2P changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- BIP 61 reject messages were deprecated in v0.18. They are now disabled\n+  by default, but can be enabled by setting the `-enablebip61` command\n+  line option.  BIP 61 reject messages will be removed entirely in a\n+  future version of Bitcoin Core. (#14054)\n+\n+- The default value for the `-peerbloomfilters` configuration option\n+  (and, thus, BIP37/BIP111 NODE_BLOOM support) has been changed to false.\n+  This eliminates well-known DoS vectors in Bitcoin Core, especially for\n+  nodes with spinning disks. Other software should still be able to\n+  connect to older versions of Bitcoin Core and users who have manually\n+  enabled NODE_BLOOM support for the near future, but developers of such\n+  software should consider migrating to an alternative over the coming\n+  years.

To uncouple the RPCs from the global option, they now have a\r\n  hardcoded default for the maximum transaction fee, that can be changed for\r\n  both RPCs on a per-call basis with the `maxfeerate` parameter. The\r\n  `allowhighfees` boolean option has been removed and replaced by the\r\n  `maxfeerate` numeric option.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRevised is:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` no longer accept a\r\n  `allowhighfees` parameter to fail mempool acceptance if the\r\n  transaction fee exceedes the value of the configuration option\r\n  `-maxtxfee`.

(#16339)\n+\n New RPCs\n --------\n \n - `getbalances` returns an object with all balances (`mine`,\n   `untrusted_pending` and `immature`). Please refer to the RPC help of\n   `getbalances` for details. The new RPC is intended to replace\n-  `getunconfirmedbalance` and the balance fields in `getwalletinfo`, as well as\n-  `getbalance`. The old calls may be removed in a future version.\n+  `getbalance`, `getunconfirmedbalance`, and the balance fields in\n+  `getwalletinfo`.  These old calls and fields may be removed in a\n+  future version. (#15930, #16239)\n+\n+- `setwalletflag` sets and unsets wallet flags that enable or disable\n+  features specific to that existing wallet, such as the new\n+  `avoid_reuse` feature documented elsewhere in these release notes.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockfilter` gets the BIP158 filter for the specified block.  This\n+  RPC is only enabled if block filters have been created using the\n+  `-blockfilterindex` configuration option. (#14121)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- `-blockfilterindex` enables the creation of BIP158 block filters for\n+  the entire blockchain.  Filters will be created in the background and\n+  currently use about 4 GiB of space.  Note: this version of Bitcoin\n+  Core does not serve block filters over the P2P network, although the\n+  local user may obtain block filters using the `getblockfilter` RPC.\n+  (#14121)\n+\n+Updated settings\n+----------------\n+\n+- `whitebind` and `whitelist` now accept a list of permissions to\n+  provide peers connecting using the indicated interfaces or IP\n+  addresses.  If no permissions are specified with an address or CIDR\n+  network, the implicit default permissions are the same as previous\n+  releases.  See the `bitcoind -help` output for these two options for\n+  details about the available permissions. (#16248)\n \n Updated RPCs\n ------------\n \n Note: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the\n Low-level Changes section below.\n \n-- The `sendmany` RPC had an argument `minconf` that was not well specified and\n-  would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's coin selection would succeed.\n-  The `sendtoaddress` RPC never had this check, so to normalize the behavior,\n-  `minconf` is now ignored in `sendmany`. If the coin selection does not\n-  succeed due to missing coins, it will still throw an RPC error. Be reminded\n-  that coin selection is influenced by the `-spendzeroconfchange`,\n-  `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains`\n-  command line arguments.\n+- `sendmany` no longer has a `minconf` argument.  This argument was not\n+  well specified and would lead to RPC errors even when the wallet's\n+  coin selection succeeded.  Users who want to influence coin selection\n+  can use the existing `-spendzeroconfchange`, `-limitancestorcount`,\n+  `-limitdescendantcount` and `-walletrejectlongchains` configuration\n+  arguments. (#15596)\n+\n+- `getbalance` and `sendtoaddress`, plus the new RPCs `getbalances` and\n+  `createwallet`, now accept an \"avoid_reuse\" parameter that controls\n+  whether already used addresses should be included in the operation.\n+  Additionally, `sendtoaddress` will avoid partial spends when\n+  `avoid_reuse` is enabled even if this feature is not already enabled\n+  via the `-avoidpartialspends` command line flag because not doing so\n+  would risk using up the \"wrong\" UTXO for an address reuse case.\n+  (#13756)\n+\n+- `listunspent` now returns a \"reused\" bool for each output if the\n+  wallet flag \"avoid_reuse\" is enabled. (#13756)\n+\n+- `getblockstats` now uses BlockUndo data instead of the transaction\n+  index, making it much faster, no longer dependent on the `-txindex`\n+  configuration option, and functional for all non-pruned blocks.\n+  (#14802)\n+\n+- `utxoupdatepsbt` now accepts a `descriptors` parameter that will fill\n+  out input and output scripts and keys when known. P2SH-witness inputs\n+  will be filled in from the UTXO set when a descriptor is provided that\n+  shows they're spending segwit outputs.  See the RPC help text for full\n+  details. (#15427)\n+\n+- `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` no longer accept a\n+  `allowhighfees` parameter to fail mempool acceptance if the\n+  transaction fee exceedes the value of the configuration option\n+  `-maxtxfee`.  Now there is a hardcoded default maximum feerate that\n+  can be changed when calling either RPC using a `maxfeerate` parameter.\n+  (#15620)\n+\n+- `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, and\n+  `getrawmempool` no longer return a `size` field unless the\n+  configuration option `-deprecatedrpc=size` is used.  Instead a new\n+  `vsize` field is returned with the transaction's virtual size\n+  (consistent with other RPCs such as `getrawtransaction`). (#15637)\n+\n+- `getwalletinfo` now includes a `scanning` field that is either `false`\n+  (no scanning) or an object with information about the duration and\n+  progress of the wallet's scanning historical blocks for transactions\n+  affecting its balances. (#15730)\n+\n+- `createwallet` accepts a new `passphrase` parameter.  If set, this\n+  will create the new wallet encrypted with the given passphrase.  If\n+  unset (the default) or set to an empty string, no encryption will be\n+  used. (#16394)\n+\n+- `getmempoolentry` now provides a `weight` field containing the\n+  transaction weight as defined in BIP141. (#16647)\n+\n+- `getdescriptorinfo` now returns an additional `checksum` field\n+  containing the checksum for the unmodified descriptor provided by the\n+  user (that is, before the descriptor is normalized for the\n+  `descriptor` field). (#15986)\n+\n+- `walletcreatefundedpsbt` now signals BIP125 Replace-by-Fee if the\n+  `-walletrbf` configuration option is set to true. (#15911)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- Provides bech32 addresses by default.  The user may change the address\n+  during invoice generation using a GUI toggle, or the default address\n+  type may be changed by the `-addresstype` configuration option.\n+  (#15711, #16497)\n+\n+Deprecated or removed configuration options\n+-------------------------------------------\n+\n+- `-mempoolreplacement` is removed, although default node behavior\n+  remains the same.  This option previously allowed the user to prevent\n+  the node from accepting or relaying BIP125 transaction replacements.\n+  This is different from the remaining configuration option\n+  `-walletrbf`. (#16171)\n \n Deprecated or removed RPCs\n --------------------------\n \n-- The `totalFee` option of the `bumpfee` RPC has been deprecated and will be\n-  removed in 0.20.  To continue using this option start with\n-  `-deprecatedrpc=totalFee`.  See the `bumpfee` RPC help text for more details.\n+- `bumpfee` no longer accepts a `totalFee` option unless the\n+  configuration parameter `deprecatedrpc=totalFee` is specified.  This\n+  parameter will be fully removed in a subsequent release. (#15996)\n+\n+- `generate` is now removed after being deprecated in Bitcoin Core 0.18.\n+  Use the `generatetoaddress` RPC instead. (#15492)\n+\n+P2P changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- BIP 61 reject messages were deprecated in v0.18. They are now disabled\n+  by default, but can be enabled by setting the `-enablebip61` command\n+  line option.  BIP 61 reject messages will be removed entirely in a\n+  future version of Bitcoin Core. (#14054)\n+\n+- To eliminate well-known denial-of-service vectors in Bitcoin Core,\n+  especially for nodes with spinning disks, the default value for the\n+  `-peerbloomfilters` configuration option has been changed to false.\n+  This prevents Bitcoin Core from sending the BIP111 NODE_BLOOM service\n+  flag, accepting BIP37 bloom filters, or serving merkle blocks or\n+  transactions matching a bloom filter.  Users who still want to provide\n+  bloom filter support may either set the configuration option to true\n+  to re-enable both BIP111 and BIP37 support or enable just BIP37\n+  support for specific peers using the updated `-whitelist` and\n+  `-whitebind` configuration options described elsewhere in these\n+  release notes.  For the near future, lightweight clients using public\n+  BIP111/BIP37 nodes should still be able to connect to older versions\n+  of Bitcoin Core and nodes that have manually enabled BIP37 support,\n+  but developers of such software should consider migrating to either\n+  using specific BIP37 nodes or an alternative transaction filtering\n+  system. (#16152)\n+\n+Miscellaneous CLI Changes\n+-------------------------\n+\n+- The `testnet` field in `bitcoin-cli -getinfo` has been renamed to\n+  `chain` and now returns the current network name as defined in BIP70\n+  (main, test, regtest). (#15566)\n \n Low-level changes\n =================\n \n RPC\n ---\n \n+- `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns a `bip9_softforks` object.\n+  Instead, information has been moved into the `softforks` object and\n+  an additional `type` field describes how Bitcoin Core determines\n+  whether that soft fork is active (e.g. BIP9 or BIP90).  See the RPC\n+  help for details. (#16060)\n+\n+- `getblocktemplate` no longer returns a `rules` array containing `CSV`\n+  and `segwit` (the BIP9 deployments that are currently in active\n+  state). (#16060)\n+\n+- `getrpcinfo` now returns a `logpath` field with the path to\n+  `debug.log`. (#15483)\n \n Tests\n -----\n \n-- The regression test chain, that can be enabled by the `-regtest` command line\n-  flag, now requires transactions to not violate standard policy by default.\n-  Making the default the same as for mainnet, makes it easier to test mainnet\n-  behavior on regtest. Be reminded that the testnet still allows non-standard\n-  txs by default and that the policy can be locally adjusted with the\n-  `-acceptnonstdtxn` command line flag for both test chains.\n+- The regression test chain enabled by the `-regtest` command line flag\n+  now requires transactions to not violate standard policy by default.\n+  This is the same default used for mainnet and makes it easier to test\n+  mainnet behavior on regtest. Note that the testnet still allows\n+  non-standard txs by default and that the policy can be locally\n+  adjusted with the `-acceptnonstdtxn` command line flag for both test\n+  chains. (#15891)\n \n Configuration\n ------------\n \n-- An error is issued where previously a warning was issued when a setting in\n-  the config file was specified in the default section, but not overridden for\n-  the selected network. This change takes only effect if the selected network\n-  is not mainnet.\n+- A setting specified in the default section but not also specified in a\n+  network-specific section (e.g. testnet) will now produce a error",
