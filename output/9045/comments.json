    "body": "@theuni While hashing is incredibly fast, it can be cause a big hit to latency for time-from-block-receive-to-relay (lower bound on hashing 1MB is around 3ms, whereas total runtime for deserialize and AcceptBlock, not including storage, is something like 15ms), especially if you received the full \"block\" message. Doing it as packets come in off the wire should never be a bottleneck - hashing is, more often than not, going to be able to easily keep up with your wire speed. This means that you can hash the message as it comes off the wire and when you receive the last packet (ie are ready to start processing) you dont have to wait for hashing to complete.\n\nIndeed, it complicates CConnman somewhat but CNetMessage will likely have to change for protocol encryption anyway, so its not like the logic in the same place isnt gonna have to learn protocol encryption.\n",
