    "body": "It seems weird-- wasteful and needlessly more identifiable-- to not emit a smaller signature when one shows up. That seems like a bad idea to me. Why not just check that the R size is <=32 bytes? Sometimes you'll be smaller and 'overpay' fee-- yes, but you'll at least get extra priority for your cost. If you instead throw out that candidate signature, you'll still pay the same, but not get the improved priority.  With that changed (or convincing me that I'm wrong), this would get a concept ACK from me. \r\n\r\nI see no security problem from doing this, though the grinding could made ~3x faster by using the endomorphism. \r\n\r\nI was going to argue that it should shave another byte off, but sipa pointed out to me that it would be plenty fast for us (esp with optimized code), it's a lot less likely that anyone else would implement that kind of signing. I think that a great point, and implementing 'lowR' certainly gets the most bang for the computational buck.  It might make sense to deploy at the same time as some other change that makes our transactions more identifiable (perhaps the recent coinselection changes count). ",

For example, in groups of 3 points related by multiplication by beta, if only two are low-R, one will be chosen 2/3rd of the time, and the other will be chosen 1/3rd of the time. I don't see a way to exploit that, but it feels scary.\r\n\r\nOut of every 24 points, instead of having 12 with probability 1/12, there will be 3 with probability 1/7, 3 with probability 2/21, and 6 with probability 1/21; overall 0.1576 bits entropy less.",

From there, they can figure out whether the first or not-first R value was small. This should reduce the space by at least a bit, if not more -- for instance if we infer that it took 10 signature attempts (which should happen once in 1024 attempts), we reduce the nonce space for that message by 1/1024.",

Unlike when deriving a public key `Q = d \u00d7 G`, where you could determine `d` by monitoring a device that performs this elliptic curve multiplication multiple times (with a not perfectly time-constant implementation ), for signatures the private key isn't used in such multiplication. Only a random nonce `k` is, which is completely different on each attempt.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell wrote:\r\n>  I think it's not good for the project that every single little thing takes forever for no obvious reason.

My bigger concern is that in cryptography it's easy to make a mistake if you don't know what you're doing. Obviously @achow101  knows what he's doing and you and @sipa are able to tell that this particular change is safe. But it's hard for me to verify what makes a simple change safe and what doesn't.",

    "body": "@JeremyRobin commented the following:\r\n\r\n> I'm also curious if there's an opportunity to leak entropy out of this as a timing attack. If the attacker can make unlimited requests, they can clearly figure out the difference between a msg that (deterministically) takes one signing time and two signing times (or more) by making a historgram of the signing times. From there, they can figure out whether the first or not-first R value was small. This should reduce the space by at least a bit, if not more -- for instance if we infer that it took 10 signature attempts (which should happen once in 1024 attempts), we reduce the nonce space for that message by 1/1024.\r\n\r\nI don't think this was addressed, is this a potential issue?",
