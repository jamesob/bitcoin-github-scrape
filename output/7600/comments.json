    "body": "This algorithm is by no means guaranteed to produce maximum fee blocks for a given mempool, if that's what you're trying to ask.\n\nThe algorithm this PR is trying to implement is straightforward:\n\n```\nLook at highest ancestor-feerate tx in mempool:\n - Add tx's package (tx + unconfirmed ancestors) to block\n - Remove tx's package from the mempool and re-sort (so that descendants of tx and its now in-block ancestors are treated as confirmed, and remaining in-mempool descendant's ancestor feerate is updated).\n```\n\nThe implementation is complicated because we can't actually remove things from the mempool.  To deal with that, I added a new multi_index that `CreateNewBlock` uses to keep track of the effective ancestor feerate/size/sigops for transactions whose in-mempool ancestors have been selected for inclusion in the block.  (The only other complication is that a package might not be includable, say because it's too big or has too many sigops, but that's easy to handle.)\n\nAnyway, getting back to the algorithm -- I think this algorithm is superior to the existing one (which iterates based on each tx's individual feerate, not looking at ancestors) for optimizing block fees, and it has the property that (what I expect to be) typical uses of CPFP should generally be captured -- namely those situations where a single child is paying a large fee for its parents.  \n\nHowever if there are multiple medium fee children that are chained below some low-fee parent, then the algorithm might easily fill the block without those transactions because they may not be considered until the block is full.  For now though I suspect this algorithm is adequate for the current usage patterns, and perhaps we can come up with ways to monitor what's in the mempool to look for patterns of usage that would motivate further improvements to `CreateNewBlock`.\n",

As entities will be able to underpay transactions without risking getting dropped from the mempool.

    "body": "> Is this algorithm also used to determine which transactions to drop?\n\n@seweso  The algorithm for eviction of transactions from the mempool is unchanged.  In a sense, the transaction eviction algorithm for the mempool is already assuming we're doing something like what this PR implements for transaction selection, in that a transaction is less likely to be evicted from the mempool if its feerate with descendants is high.  But more fundamentally, mempool eviction is just a different problem than transaction selection: when selecting transactions for a block, a candidate transaction's ancestors must be included (so it's natural to sort by feerate-with-ancestors), but when considering a transaction for mempool eviction, a candidate transaction's descendants must also be removed as well (so we use `max(feerate, feerate with descendants)` as our sort order for removal).\n",

Finally, rather than using sdaftuar record and replay framework, I scraped all the recent transactions out of recent blocks, reorged the chain back and put all the still-valid transactions into the mempool and confirmed it gave a valid gbt result with higher total fees than the before the patch, I tried this at a dozen different points. \n",
