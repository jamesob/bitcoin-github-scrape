    "body": "(Edited for some inaccuracies pointed out by sipa)\r\n\r\n~The main thing is that people often call mininodes \"nodes\" when they are not, so we want to remove that naming.~ I think the main thing is that we don't want people to confuse mininodes (a minimal p2p interface) with testnodes (the bitcoind node we are testing in functional tests). I was skeptical about calling it \"p2p\" at first as well but, right now, it sounds most sensible to me. Open to discussion.\r\n\r\nCalling it MockNode would be even more confusing I think, because that sounds so similar to TestNode, and we often \"mock\" things (e.g. time) so that we can manipulate them in the functional tests. I'd even be ok with renaming TestNode to MockNode.\r\n\r\nI can't really think of anything that mininodes do other than send/receive p2p messages. I think of mininodes as fake peers (but only when connected, as jnewbery said above) that we have full control over, and can use to elicit some behavior from the TestNode(s). ~But all they can do is p2p messages, nothing more, so it's incorrect to call them \"__nodes\".~  The reason I think \"p2p\" is an appropriate name is that they only implement that portion of node functionality. Mininodes cannot validate anything and cannot make transactions or blocks (only send them). I'm pretty sure they're only able to connect to 1 TestNode at a time. They also don't even always follow p2p protocol (which can be a conservative definition of a node) e.g. p2p_leak.py.",

To recenter on the changes this PR is making:\r\n\r\n- we have a file that contains our python implementation of a p2p stack. It contains a `P2PConnection` object (a low level connection to a bitcoind node's P2P interface) and a `P2PInterface` (a higher level object that allows us to communicate with the node's net_processing layer and register callbacks). This file is currently called mininode.py, which doesn't convey much meaning. A better name for it is p2p.py which more clearly communicates what it is and does.\r\n- data which can be accessed by both the test logic thread and the networking thread is guarded by a global mutex called mininode_lock. Again, that doesn't convey much meaning so rename it to p2p_lock (since it's data that is used by our p2p interface objects).\r\n- fix up related comments.\r\n\r\nThat's all that this PR does.\r\n\r\nRebased on master.",
