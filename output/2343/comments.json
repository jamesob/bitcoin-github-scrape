One way to do that may be to just assume that there is always a change output while computing a conservative size.\n",

Testing is great, but merging this produces a net decrease in user bug exposure even if it isn't perfect.\n\nAlternatively: since this functionality is hidden from the user by default, put a \"WARNING: alpha quality\" next to the checkbox they need to check in order to enable it.\n",

It's one of the factors that determines if the transaction can be free or not, and influences how fast it can be mined. I am totally confused as to what you're thinking there.\n\nA tooltip is effectively hidden, especially one that takes a half second hover on a tiny icon. Why not make it the number?\n\nThe asterisk fails on discoverability: I couldn't find it and I looked (tried left and right clicking in several places but not your ~~\u03c0 symbol~~ \\* symbol. :P   If I can't figure it out, knowing that it should have something there\u2014 might want to consider another approach.\n",

Produces a transaction that pays 1e-8 in fees.\n\nor,\nSelect 50 BTC input. Shows fee: 0. Send 1e-8 BTC.  Prompts to charge for a 0.0005 fee. abort.\n\nor,\nSelect 50 BTC input. Shows fee: 0.  Send 49.99999999 and second output of 1e-8.  Insufficient funds.\n\nThese are all because the coin control doesn't override the normal fee logic, which is good and fine, overriding it would result in stuck coins. I was using tiny outputs to trigger fees but the same should probably crop up for low priority.  But the fact the it claims to display the fees but doesn't really is super confusing.\n\nI might suggest that the fee display actually be brought onto the main send coins display in the panel with the send button. When coins are selected it should show the fee, size, and priority (turning red for low priority, making the fee in the case explicable), and change amounts for the selected inputs and specified outputs. \n",

Depending which rule you violated.\n  Those 4 labels also have tool tips explaining this.\n  Also remember that violating one of the first 2 rules means 0.0005 PER kilobyte min-fee,\n  while violating one of the last 2 means 0.0005 min-fee only.\n",

The only critical code is in wallet.cpp\nthats 2 if-statements and some get-set methods. It is only tampering with inputs and outputs of transactions\nthats it, its not touching the wallet directly.\n\nAnyway I hope I can kick myself in the ass and create a testing plan this week, I will send this gavin for review and then publish if he says testing plan is ok. Then I will test the new multi-wallet commit with this and then publish testing plan and rebase this, to get this finally merged. Until then theres no sense rebasing this all the time. \n",

    "body": "The changes to core look very sane (I haven't looked at the Qt code), but one thing I'm unconfortable with: coin control settings effectively become per-wallet state. That means that when using coin control from within Qt, it will also affect transactions created via RPC (which doesn't have the same feature at all). Ideally, I'd say the coin control capabilities are abstracted into a separate class, an instance of which can be passed to the sendtransaction & co methods.\n",

A change address appears grouped with the wallet address which was used as an input to the transaction which has the change address as an output.\n\nOf course, this isn't the only way in which a change-address and non-change-address might be \"related\" in the blockchain, and it's possible for two non-change-addresses to be \"related\" this way.  The addresses won't appear \"related\" in the tree view in these situations.  But both of these situations arise as the result of some deliberate action on the user's part (or some other user's part), so I think the tree view is just showing you address relationships that arise as a result of the client's automatic change-management decisions rather than the user's deliberate transaction requests.\n",

    "body": "> that it is change is not represented in the transaction itself\n\n@luke-jr, do you mean:\n1. In the blockchain?  Of course not.\n2. In a client's local transaction records?  The client can make note of the purpose for which a private key was created (to receive change or not) at the time of its creation.\n3. In the bitcoin-qt client implementation in particular?  See wallet.cpp, bool CWallet::IsChange() -- it's essentially doing (2) using the \"address book\" part of the wallet to determine the creation purpose.  If the user created the address for non-change purposes it gets put in the address book.  If it's not in there, the cilent assumes it was created in order to receive change.\n",

I have not implemented rpc, but would be trivial now.\n    CCoinControl class is passed as parameter into createTransaction() also in AvailableCoins().\n    In AvailableCoins() this is where the actual coin control is done, its the same line of code\n    where you asked if isLockedUnspent before\n- dust logic\n  - at least in my tests it turned out that dust is actual 5460 satoshis, not 5430\n  - if you enter dust as recipient Amount the label Low Ouput shows \"DUST\"\n  - fee is calculated correctly according to dust, this is when change would be dust, its added to the fee\n- fixed a (for me) very annoying compiler warning in a separate commit\n- some minor improvements, not really worth mentioning, like improving start-up time of the popup if you had a lot of outputs selected, change address warnings are now red etc.\n\n@luke-jr: sry, your spacebar-bug would require to create a separate treewidget class and overwrite keypressevent, so I leave this unfixed for now\n",

    "body": "Maybe my comment wasn't clear, but this isn't what I meant at all. You've now moved the coin control logic to a separate class, but it's still kept as state in CWallet (and in addition, it holds a backreference to the wallet it is part of...).\n\nThe idea was to have something like CCoinControl, but just use it as a optional argument passed to CreateTransactions & co, not to store it in the wallet itself. RPC's that call createtransaction wouldn't pass it, normal GUI transaction wouldn't pass it, but creating a transaction using coin control would construct such an object from what is set in the GUI, and pass it along. If you're storing it in the wallet itself, it may interfere with other calls to CreateTransaction that don't want coin control. Also, I don't think the CoinControl object needs methods that interfact with the wallet; it should just group some settings.\n\nIn short: don't let coin control be part of the wallet state, just make it an optional argument.\n\nApart from that, thanks for rebasing and updating. I'd really like to see this get merged.\n",

I simply assume 180 bytes for all. Same for compressed, but with 32 bytes less. The only way to give 100% accurate bytes would be to actually create and sign the transaction for every click in coin control, which would be overkill in my opinion. So bytes is just an extreme good guess.\n\n@wtogami \n- I put the OK button on the left on purpose, because checkboxes are on the left, otherwise my mouse ways were to long, I had to move mouse from left to right all the time, I hated that\n- I have tested some compressed/uncompressed inputs, I can not say more than \"It works for me\". In your case it really looks like there has been a false detection of compressed/uncompressed. But I dont know what else to test.\n- your phenomenom with the 45 low-medium switching to medium is correct behaviour. This is because if you only select 1 input, I have to add 78 bytes for the output here. This is 2 \\* 34 + 10. 2 outputs and 10 bytes transaction overhead. Now if you select 45 inputs, also I only add 78 bytes, because selecting more inputs does not mean you have more outputs, you still have 2 outputs. So the more inputs you select, the less \"meaningful\" are 78 bytes for the math-calculation. This means you can actually \"cheat\" your priority up, by selecting more inputs. But thats not my fault, thats how bitcoin priority calculation works. I mean with the power of coin control you can always cheat up your priority, simply by selecting a huge input, although it is not needed and then send this coins back to yourself as change.\n- Your last question above does not really make sense. An output is always 34 bytes, its a ripe160 hash,\n  there is no compressed/uncompressed. Only the input is either 180 or 148 bytes, depending on compressed/uncompressed. \n",

    "body": "Yes, there is some duplication of fee logic. The stuff hardcoded in CreateTransaction(..) in wallet.cpp \nis not so easy to get rid of. But we could change the GetMinFee(..) method in main.cpp, so that it takes a parameter nBytes, and then do not serialize the CTransaction in this method, but use this parameter nBytes as size. When we call GetMinFee(..), we serialize the transaction anyway, and have nBytes available, so actually\nwe serialize the transaction again all the time in GetMinFee(..) which is not really necessary.\n\nIf you want I can change the GetMinFee(..) in main.cpp, this would then remove like 8 lines of fee logic in coin control. Maybe in a separate pull?\n",

    "body": "Not break, but the rpc scenario to consider is:\nCoin control thinks the selected output is spendable, while actually the output is spent.\nThis can happen if you spent an output with rpc while working around in the sendcoinsdialog.\nSo you select an output with coin control, then spend it with rpc.\nThe selected spent output is then stucked in the coin control selection, because it is selected, but does not appear in the popup anymore.\nWorst case here is getting a weird \"Amount Exceeds Balance\" and you dont understand why.\nA clear() which would remove the stucked output and solve the problem is triggered by:\n- click unselectAll\n- disable coin control\n- sending a succesful tx in gui. This happens if the balance of the other selected was enough\n  to satisfy the transaction. Of course the spent/locked output would not be part of the transaction.\n  If stucked is the only one, you would get \"Amount Exceeds Balance\" all the time.\n\nThe scenario is unlikely and uncritical, but maybe I should write a simple check function, which checks if all selected are still unlocked and spendable, and then call this\non popup open and before click \"Send\". If you click \"Send\" and there had been a stucked output, I would return \"transaction creation failed\" and the coin control labels would refresh, so one can see, that someting has changed,  like the output has been spent in the meantime.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

    "body": "update:\n- code nits\n  - introduced GUIUtil::setClipboard\n  - calling getBalance(coinControl) now in walletmodel.cpp\n  - replaced \"WARNING\" with \"Warning\"\n  - added notr=\"true\" to ui non translatable strings\n- added \"coinControlUpdateLabels();\" at the end of SendCoinsDialog::pasteEntry(..).\n  This is because payment-request did not trigger label refresh.\n- reverted some changes from the last commit for #2945:\n  I forgot uncompressed keys are over the limit. The ignore limit introduced by #2945\n  is 151 bytes. An input with uncompressed key is 180 bytes. So I credit 29 bytes per uncompressed input. This is priority calculation only.\n\n@Diapolo yes, I honor display units\n\nTested payment request. No problems found, besides the \"coinControlUpdateLabels();\" call mentioned above.\n\nLatest 0.8.5 backport: http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoincoincont/files/bitcoin-0.8.5-coincontrol.tar.gz/download\n\nTestplan still the same: https://github.com/cozz/bitcoin/blob/cozz1/cctestplan.md\n",
