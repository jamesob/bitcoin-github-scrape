Disabling those entirely on testnet means that it can't be used to test whether such relay rules actually work.\n",

    "body": "It's still changeable per node with \"-acceptnonstdtxn\" on test and regtest.\n\nThe way I was looking at this commit was that it makes the application or non-application of standard-ness validation, as controlled by \"-acceptnonstdtxn\", more complete.\n\nI think fRequireStandard in the chain params is false for these two networks in order to not inhibit propagation and inclusion of possibly surprising valid stuff, and hopefully catch related bugs in non-prod testing.\n\nI see your point though too. On regtest this change was definitely helpful for my local testing. On testnet3, because standard-ness validation is the default for what I was testing in current nodes, it's kind of sterile. I was having trouble getting relay and I couldn't find good info on current testnet miner policies or where I could submit to a miner that accepted non-standard testnet transactions (which makes sense, but it was kind of a pain).\n",
