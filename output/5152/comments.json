As it stands, users are either downloading a dmg, or building themselves. Adding a hybrid 3rd option will only complicate things further, and OSX is hard enough to maintain as it is.\n\nAdding to that, there are some things that a distributed dmg provides, disabling app-nap for example.\n\nAs for a recipe to create a dmg, we already have that with our depends system:\n\n``` sh\n$ make -C depends\n$ ./autogen.sh\n$ ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/x86_64-apple-darwin*\n$ make deploy\n```\n\nAgain, I'm having a hard time seeing how involving homebrew would be beneficial.\n",

    "body": "It isn't intended necessarily for Bitcoin themselves, but rather end users. It is the \"building themselves\" crowd that I had in mind here, especially on OS X, given your build documentation for users involves Homebrew already, and internalising everything into one script helps reduce variables that crop up as in #5147. This is a kind of extension of your build documentation, but reduces the amount end users have to do and the places where that can go wrong to nil. (_Theoretically_).\n\nI wasn't deliberately proposing a third option, my opinion was more \"Hey, this could be your building yourself option for OS X\".\n\nI don't have anything against pre-distributed dmg files at all, and I'd certainly generally desire and urge people to use those instead of building the tools here themselves, but this being the crypto world there is always going to be an element who stare at pre-distributed binaries with some suspicion.\n\nMy point largely was that you already involve Homebrew in your [documentation for osx](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md), so this is just an extension of that, but as I said, I only really threw this together to check there wasn't any SSLv2 errors on Homebrew's end of the deal for #5147, and it just occurred to me afterwards that it might be useful for that minority of users on OS X who decide to build these things themselves instead of trusting a dmg.\n\n(_Again, I have no beef against signed distributed binaries_).\n",

    "body": "I wouldn't disagree with your assessment there at all. Indeed, half the confusion when I was looking into #5147 was _\"Bitcoin have this incredible self-building dependency system, why are they using Homebrew?\"_ and then _\"If they're using Homebrew, why aren't they using the full power of Homebrew to fully automate the build process on OS X for those who prefer to build from source?\"_.\n\nIMO, You have two incredible systems, Homebrew and your internal dependency build-process, and the current documentation seems to conflict over which people should use. Homebrew is incredible, and the internal-dependency system is incredible, but melding the two together is a confusing choice.\n\n_(None of this is a critique of the team here. You guys consistently smash it out of the park)._\n",

If you want it in, I'll make whatever changes you see fit. \n\nNote that Homebrew will almost certainly _never_ accept a bitcoind formula into the core, so there is zero chance of this ever being \"bottled\". Bottles are only generated by the core formulae and certain specific other taps. Bottles are not generated for every formulae in every tap, Homebrew doesn't have the resources to quite manage that I suspect.\n\nYou can also add an extremely simple build-flag to the instructions to ensure every dependency is built-from-source as well, so everything comes by source. It takes longer, but if you want source that's something Homebrew can bend to extremely easily.\n",

    "body": "Yeah, I tried that, but it wasn't particularly interested and still flagged the incompatible to me, frustratingly. The PATH ENV setting does something similar, it just moves the internal BDB4 location to the front of the PATH so the build script finds it first and foremost. (For the duration of the build script).\n\nThere are various ways to try and stop it finding another elsewhere, which I'll try, but I'm not sure if the way the configure script determined the BDB4 dependency, `BREW --prefix berkeley-db4` is breaking that. It's a perfectly valid and solid way of finding the BDB4 dependency for Bitcoin, but it can be a pain in terms of if you use Homebrew but have the BDB4 you want to use elsewhere.\n\nIf I can't get it to take flags or PATH temporary amendments without still bumping into the issue I may end up inserting a tiny patch to the configure script in the formula on my end to ensure it finds our BDB4 instead of Homebrew's default.\n",

    "body": "@DomT4 Confirmed working here with the changes described above. It seems homebrew removes itself from $PATH so that our 'brew' stuff never runs anyway. But it sets it up the same way we would have.\n\nAs I mentioned before, there's no need to mess with the PATH for bdb, it's never used. Only the includes/libs matter. Here's a working version with no patching required: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yLtbzzug\n",
