We lose nothing by gossiping an address to SPV peers, as long as we also gossip to two \"address relay\" peers.\r\n\r\nWe don't know whether there are clients that rely on receiving address gossips.

If an SPV client wants to request fresh addresses, they'd need to disconnect-reconnect-GETADDR, which seems undesirable.\r\n\r\n> `<aj> how about just biassing against picking peers for the 1 or 2 to relay for if those peers haven't sent us ADDR messages already, if that makes sense?`\r\n\r\n(http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-10-17.html#l-591)\r\n\r\nThis seems even better to me.
