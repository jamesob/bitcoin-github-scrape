Testing this is a good use of #12134, though such test should be in a separate PR to prevent a long wait.\r\n\r\nJust tested with 0.17 and 0.16. 0.17 knows what the wallet flags are so it does understand the mandatory flag and refuses to load wallets with the blank flag set. ~~However 0.16 does not know about wallet flags and will actually load the wallet and generate keys for it. It does this for both wallets with private keys disabled and blank wallets, which might be an issue. However I noticed it is a bit harder to move back to 0.16 due to the wallet directory change where wallets are now directories instead of just files. But this is an issue in general for wallet flags.~~ 0.16 does not open these wallets because the version number was bumped for 0.17.",

Are you sure you compiled it right? I just tried using the `v0.16.3` binary and it refused to open a wallet with `WALLET_FLAG_DISABLE_PRIVATE_KEYS`, because the version was too new.\r\n\r\nBy the way, let's make sure we don't get in the way of #13756 which introduces `MUTABLE_WALLET_FLAGS`, flags that once set can't be changed.",

This should also help with #14075.\r\n\r\nI got rid of `IsBlank` and replaced it with two functions: `CanGenerateKeys` and `CanGetAddresses`. `CanGenerateKeys` is as @ryanofsky commented; it checks for whether there is an HD seed or whether the wallet is non-HD. `CanGetAddresses` checks whether there are keys in the keypool (defaults to external keypool but can check the internal one), and if not, checks `CanGenerateKeys`. This is used as a guard wherever a key from the keypool is fetched for addresses. Additionally this is called by `WalletModel::CanGetAddresses()` and replaces the logic that was there.",

    "body": "In commit \"[wallet] Support creating a blank wallet\" (8061ea4611696b22d5d5dcdd73c1e053ffecc09d)\r\n\r\nI think there is no point to checking WALLET_FLAG_BLANK_WALLET here. It's redundant and just complicates the logic.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think this function should be called IsBlank, because this creates two slightly different definitions of blank, one where a wallet stops being blank when a watch-only address is added (WALLET_FLAG_BLANK_WALLET), and one which remains blank (IsBlank). I think a more accurate name for this function would be CannotGenerateKeys, but even better would be:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool CWallet::CanGenerateKeys()\r\n{\r\n    // Wallet can generate keys if it has an HD seed, or is a pre-hd wallet.\r\n    return IsHDEnabled() || !CanSupportFeature(FEATURE_HD);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich could simplify all the places where this is called, as well as the canGetAddresses GUI function.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed suggested name from `CanGenerateAddresses` to `CanGenerateKeys` in light of #14075",

CanGetAddresses() is definitely useful for the GUI, because the GUI has to continuously keep its display state up to date with state of the keypool, and this is inherently racy and approximate. But actual wallet code shouldn't be doing racy, redundant checks like this. There's no point to locking cs_wallet, checking the number of available keys in the keypool, releasing the lock, reacquiring the lock and then doing the same check again below in ReserveKey.\r\n\r\n",
