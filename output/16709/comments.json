The problem with that is the lack of interrupt() in std::thread, both bench and test make use of boost::thread::interrupt() via boost::thread_group::interrupt_all(), which previously would have exited threads waiting in boost::condition_variable::wait().\r\n\r\nMore work is required for a solution that maintains test and bench compatibility without being cumbersome. If a suitable native solution is created boost::thread_group threadGroup variable in init.cpp could also be replaced as well as some tests.",
