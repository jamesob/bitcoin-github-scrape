    "body": "Thank you for working on this!\n\nI think we should be careful here though. `importprivkey` has a number a quirks that are for historical or compatibility reasons, that we shouldn't maintain:\n* `importprivkey` does not know what the corresponding address is, and thus can't know what type to use (p2pkh, p2sh-p2wpkh, p2wpkh), and thus has to assume all are possible (which results in at least labelling all 3). For `importmulti` we generally *do* have the address available. The goal here could be to provide a *default* address type (or explicitly name the type); not keep assuming it can be any.\n* Relatedly, we don't have an encoding for \"private key whose address is supposed to be P2SH-P2WPKH\". My suggestion would be to add one (I believe Electrum has some sort of standard for this). `importprivkey` can't really use these, because it already has to assume it can be any type, but `importmulti` does not need to repeat this. It could assume just P2PKH for a legacy WIP encoding, and P2SH/P2WPKH when one of those novel encodings is used.\n* `importprivkey` doesn't support key birth times; but this is not inherent, keys can have birth times.",

    "body": "> One question is if this should be simplified to where a user can put private keys in keys and leave scriptPubKey empty, or if it makes more sense to add a new field as I do here.\r\n\r\nI think it should absolutely use `keys` - there is no need to add new fields to just provide the same functionality in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe way it should work IMO is that it integrates into all the functionality that exists (including labels, birth times), but simply permit the scriptpubkey/address (and for p2sh-p2wpkh, also the redeemscript) to be omitted and computed by default from the private key - provided we have figured out how to deal with the encoding of different types of address derivation.",
