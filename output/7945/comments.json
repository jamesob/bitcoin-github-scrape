    "body": "Not yet. It's building quickly now because it's been incrementally cached. The issue will be fresh builds with no cache (#7165 as an example, which will essentially be a complete rebuild).\n\nI think we should work on speeding up tests first. I played around with parallelizing the rpc tests yesterday with reasonable success.\n\nAdditionally, https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/706 will buy us a few extra minutes, as we'll be able to switched to the stripped down image that should startup quicker.\n\n@MarcoFalke to see where we stand, you could try merging #7165 in here and seeing how long it takes.\n",
