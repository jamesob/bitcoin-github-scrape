Should no rebroadcasts happen in an ideal world where miners have an identical mempool to ours and mine rationally?\r\n\r\nbased on the local mempool, we are attempting to answer the question of what txns we think should have been mined. And saying if it wasn't, maybe there was an issue with relay. \r\nYou are correct- in a world where all mempools are consistent there wouldn't be rebroadcasts.\r\n\r\n> As to 2) from what I understand, BlockAssembler creates a block template with 3/4*MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT including the top feerate packages of our current mempool. Wouldn\u2019t it always fill this block template with txns if our mempool is large enough, and therefore rather include 75% of the txns that we expect to be mined in the next block, instead of txns that should have been mined in the past?\r\n\r\nyes. you will start with txns you expect to be mined in the next block. the recency filter will (likely) remove some of those transactions. however, in the case of a mempool thats emptying out, the recency filter might not have much effect. for that I have this todo before the PR would be ready for merge: \r\n> add functionality to run an automated job to cache min fee rate for txns to be included in block, then apply that filter to exclude txns with fee rate < min from rebroadcast set",

    "body": "great questions @mzumsande. I've thought about this a lot, so let me share some of my reasoning- \r\n \r\n> What confuses me is how we can answer that without actually looking into recent blocks.\r\n\r\nWe can't. And further, even if we do look at the recent blocks, we still cannot answer exactly what \"should\" have been included. The two main pieces of information we are missing are 1. what the miner's mempool looked like and 2. any weight applied through `prioritisetransaction`. By looking at a block, it is difficult to extrapolate the exact minimum fee rate for transactions to be included. So instead, the approach here is for a node to look at its local mempool and work towards the picture of what it believes should have already been included.  \r\n\r\n> so we are left with txns that were not at the top of the mempool earlier but are now, which we wouldn't want to rebroadcast. \r\n\r\nyup, specifically in the case of the emptying out mempool, we would currently rebroadcast a full set of txns, thats why I want to build a cache of min fee rate and apply an extra filter to reduce noise in this circumstance ( from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#issuecomment-524480540 ): \r\n\r\n> add functionality to run an automated job to cache min fee rate for txns to be included in block, then apply that filter to exclude txns with fee rate < min from rebroadcast set. this will reduce rebroadcast noise in scenarios where the mempool is emptying out.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe crux of the thinking is that we are not going to get the rebroadcast set perfect, but that is ok. When a node rebroadcasts a txn, it sends an INV message to new connections (see `filterInventoryKnown`). Since INV messages are relatively small & can incorporate many transactions, we have some leeway. \r\n\r\nAll these different mechanisms are to reduce noise. I want to ensure the parameters chosen allow the worst case scenario (rebroadcasting the full set) to not be disruptive to the network. And these mechanisms should make the worst case infrequent.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense to you? Let me know if you still have questions. ",

    "body": "thanks for the reviews @JeremyRubin & @instagibbs. I'm making my way through them, but want to leave a high level comment- the biggest concern with these changes is the bandwidth impact to the node & network. The parameters I have currently chosen are fairly arbitrary, with the intent of keeping the size of the rebroadcast set small but meaningful. I'm working on running a node with some extra logging, and will share my findings once I have some real world data. Also can tweak parameters based on that info if needed. ",

    "body": "Concept ACK on improving privacy here. I still need to put more work in going into the details of the approach but I took down some notes while looking over the code and previous discussions:\r\n- Implications of empty blocks were mentioned in PR Review Club and I just want to echo here that the behavior should be investigated and documented here. In addition to that, I can also see cases arise of blocks that are full but have a much lower fee rate than the mempool. Miners could have exclusive deals with parties that do not want to broadcast their transactions to the network and pay the miners privately to mine their transactions. Also, I thought of a case where a miner was sweeping a lot of dust outputs from publicly known private keys in a huge transaction a few months ago (did not find the link right now).\r\n- One heuristic that came to mind to detect the former case is comparing fee rate ranges, i.e. if the fee rate of the latest block was just flat 1 sat/byte but our block template says we would expect a range of 20 - 50 sat/byte, probably something is going on that is out of our control and a rebroadcast would not change this.\r\n- I am not so happy with the changes in the miner code as they are not concerns of the miner. Naively, I would suggest a more \"functional\" design within `GetRebroadcastTransactions`: A block template would be requested from unchanged miner code and then run through a series of filters that kick out rebroadcast candidates for different reasons. IMO it would make code easier to reason about, filters could be added/removed as the behavior of different combinations are tested and they should be easily unit testable. In pseudo-code:\r\n```\r\ncandidates = getBlockTemplate();\r\nfilterRecentTransactions(candidates);\r\nfilterOverMinFee(candidates, minFeeCache);\r\n...\r\nreturn candidates;\r\n```\r\n- My suggestion in the latter point also includes a behavior change: recent transactions are filtered after the template is constructed and not before. And I think this also makes sense on a conceptual level. Let's say we have a full block of up to 20 sat/byte txs that are older and should be rebroadcast per your logic and we also have just received over a block full of new 30 sat/byte txs. We would rebroadcast txs of <= 20 sat/byte although we know that they actually will not make it into the next 1-2 blocks because there are these 30 sat/byte txs, which well-connected miners probably received even earlier than we did. So we might as well hold off from rebroadcasting them right now. I think it's right to not rebroadcast recent transactions but we should not ignore their existence either. This may be a controversial point but I think we can save network traffic by deferring rebroadcasting in this case.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I am also experiencing the test failures mentioned by others but only when running them through the test harness. In that case, `wallet_resendwallettransactions.py` fails consistently for me and `mempool_rebroadcast.py` fails about 80% of the time.",

    "body": "first off, thank you all for the thoughtful reviews! here is an update: \r\n\r\nTLDR; overview of this PR & open threads [here](https://gist.github.com/amitiuttarwar/b592ee410e1f02ac0d44fcbed4621dba).\r\nYou can help me move this PR forward by\r\n1. approach ACKs or explaining unaddressed concerns\r\n2. running the `mempool_rebroadcast` test and sharing your results with me.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI pushed changes that ...\r\n* should fix the test failures -> there was an uninitialized variable that only failed sporadically due to shared memory space, causing the test to have different results on different operating systems. Got the test to succeed on ubuntu & it passes on travis, but looks like appveyor is failing. Might be a different issue, looks like I need to debug further \ud83d\ude2c. \r\nI'd love some reviewers to run the tests to see if it passes locally / share failure logs with me. \r\n* address most misc review comments (a couple small ones are still open)\r\n* rebased \r\n* renamed `ResendWalletTransactions` to `ResubmitWalletTransactionsToMempool` to make it very clear that the wallet submits txns to the local mempool, not the network. \r\n\r\nBy my count, this PR currently has 7 concept ACKS & 0 NACKs. To move these changes forward I'm currently monitoring the patch on the network & am working on improving the monitoring mechanisms to make it easy for reviewers to see the results of & run themselves if willing. Simultaneously I'm working to address conceptual concerns & hope to begin receiving approach ACKs.\r\n\r\nI've updated the gist in OP ([link](https://gist.github.com/amitiuttarwar/b592ee410e1f02ac0d44fcbed4621dba)) with an overview of the changes, open threads & concerns, monitoring results, etc. My intention is to capture all the branches in an understandable way and make it easier for reviewers to follow. I've tried to capture all open conceptual concerns there.\r\n\r\nThe biggest question we all have about these changes is the bandwidth impact. While I have implemented various mechanisms to mitigate, its important to monitor the patch live and observe results. \r\n\r\nI'm keeping the gist updated with the results of my monitoring. Copy pasting the latest results:\r\n```\r\nafter running the patch for..\r\n10 days, node has only outbound connections -> 30 additional invs sent to peers (28, 2, 1)\r\n6 days, node also accepts incoming connections -> 186 additional invs sent to peers (22, 29, 28, 2, 3, 24, 35, 7, 5, 3, 28)\r\n\r\nSince each inv message is 36 bytes, this means...\r\n~1 kb of data sent in 10 days with only outbound connections\r\n~6.5 kb of data sent in 6 days when also accepting incoming connections\r\n```\r\n\r\n--\r\nresponses to individual conceptual concerns \r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin - I've updated the gist with these topics, but answering here as well. \r\n* mining code as a dependency -> if reviewers agree with the concern around introducing a dependency on the mining code for non-mining nodes, I think the best way to address would be a kill switch to disable rebroadcasting. creating a bounded-size priority queue might be viable, but would significantly increase the complexity of this diff so I hope to avoid. A switch to disable would have some fingerprint leaks but much less than a customizable rebroadcast interval, and the ability to disable addresses any bandwidth issues for low resourced nodes. Thoughts? \r\n\r\n* using compact-blocks relay code - seems like a suggestion to address concerns around bandwidth usage, which I believe can be addressed in simpler ways. to use compact-blocks, we'd have to introduce a different P2P message to indicate these are mempool transactions.\r\n\r\n@fjahr - thank you for your thoughtful review. here are my responses-\r\n* changes to the miner code -> initially I tried to take the approach of getting the block template then applying the filters. the issue that arose with the recency filter has to do with processing packages. consider a CPFP case. If the child arrives in the past 5 minutes and causes the parent to be in the block template, the parent should also be filtered out by the recency logic (aka not rebroadcast). Updating the miner logic takes care of this automatically. If we are to apply filters after retrieving the template, we would have to reconstruct the dependency tree to handle appropriately. I agree with you that its not an ideal separation of concerns, but the flip would be unnecessary code complexity and computation that I believe would be harder to reason about and an undesirable tradeoff in processing time. Let me know if that makes sense or if you have further concerns / considerations.\r\n\r\n* comparing fee rate ranges -> I've thought a lot about the idea of comparing fee-rate expectations based on our mempool vs the block, and I've been entirely unable to come up with any mechanisms robust for all situations. While _maybe_ we would be able to _look_ at a block and identify that a miner is intentionally choosing low fee rate transactions over high fee rate ones, I haven't been able to figure out a way to identify that algorithmically. To allow some room for manual priority is why I chose the rebroadcast set to begin with 3/4 block weight instead of a full block. Similarly, its possible to have a case where txns have successfully propagated the network but are intentionally being censored. While that would mean a lot of not useful transactions being rebroadcast, the network would have bigger issues. I'm happy to discuss this further (maybe in a DM convo & we can share a summary) if you'd like to hear more about strategies I have thought through, or if you have ideas for potentially viable strategies for automated rules to detect. \r\n\r\n* my understanding is that your example with 20 vs 30 sat/byte txns is trying to capture a situation where the miner receives transactions that you don't & they are higher fee rate. Since it only takes a max of a few seconds for txns to propagate the network, I don't think we would run into a dramatic race condition here. so that means the situation you've described here converges on the one you're talking about earlier where a miner picks up txns that are unseen to the network. Again, I haven't figured out any sensical way of algorithmically determining such case. Its possible but doesn't seem worth the tradeoffs (storing a lot of extra data). In the current implementation, if this case does occasionally occur, I think it would be ok because of all the other bandwidth mitigation (max 3/4 block, inv messages only sent to peers that didn't receive recently because of filterInventoryKnown). \r\n\r\n* empty blocks -> still have to think this one fully through. I'll do so soon & update the gist.",

    "body": "> I think the best way to address would be a kill switch to disable rebroadcasting.\r\n\r\nThere is one, -walletbroadcast=0.\r\n\r\nHow should this be handling dependencies?\r\n\r\nIf you are merely filtering on feerate will you end up with a situation where you rebroadcast a child transaction that has a high feerate even when the low feerate of its parent means it has no chance of being included?\r\n\r\nHas anyone considered significantly increasing the time between rebroadcasts as an additional change (and one that could go in separately much faster)? Particularly once you've performed one *successful* broadcast per execution additional rebroadcasts usually do nothing except leak data to attackers that frequently reconnect to you-- you won't resend to a host you've sent to before, and its not usually useful to do so.  This wouldn't obviate the need to be more intelligent, but it would reduce the bleeding and also make it more acceptable for the rest of the change to be more approximate.\r\n\r\n> Miners could have exclusive deals with parties that do not want to broadcast their transactions to the network and pay the miners privately to mine their transactions. \r\n\r\nThis sort of concern would be substantially mitigated by not rebroadcasting as soon as the transaction is 'missed' but only after it is missed by N blocks (say 3) blocks where, according to your mempool they should have included the transaction.  Then you would only rebroadcast inappropriately if all 3 miners should have included it but skipped it for some reason.\r\n\r\n> The biggest question we all have about these changes is the bandwidth impact. \r\n\r\nBandwidth impact should be somewhat mitigated by the fact that the known filters should block many of the rebroadcasts to long running peers.\r\n\r\nFWIW,  I missed on the first pass that this change makes rebroadcasting apply to all mempool transactions.   I think that is conceptually a very good move but it has *considerable* implications.\r\n\r\nLooking at your average bandwidth usage isn't enough, you have to worry about cases like what if all nodes are running into their mempool limits under high load-- will this change cause the network to start DOS attacking itself?\r\n\r\n> Would this PR be better if we used a \"thin blocks\" style relay? We already form a block template, but then we don't take advantage of the compact-blocks relay code which would minimize the data sent, assuming the neighbor node does have most of what we rebroadcast...\r\n\r\nCompact blocks would be entirely the wrong mechanism.  The transactions are unordered, unlike a block.   And they are almost entirely known.  The mechanism you want is the erlay reconcillation mechanism because it uses bandwidth equal to the size of the actual set difference, not the size of the mempool.\r\n\r\nIn fact with that mechanism, *in theory* there is no need to do any additional mempool feerate tracking, comparisons with blocks or whatever.  Just use erlay to send IDs for the entire mempool (filtered only by the peer's current relay minimum feerate) after every block. This takes bandwidth equal to 4 bytes times the number of differences, no bytes per entry in common. \r\n\r\nHowever, in practice it isn't that simple. While designing erlay we specifically consider and discarded the approach of making it work by synchronizing the mempools (which was how I approached the relay efficiency problem in my original writeup).  The reason for this is that difference in mempool policy (standardness, minfees, maximum mempool sizes, ancestor depth limits, softforks) or even just simple transaction ordering causes persistent network-wide bandwidth leaks if you relay by syncing the mempool.\r\n\r\nAll these problems also apply here, because this is essentially a mempool syncing proposal, but even worse because compared to the erlay reconciliation this is an extremely inefficient way of syncing: it spends bandwidth for transactions the peer already knows.\r\n\r\nConsider an attacker that monitors the network and finds nodes close to miners.  Then he sends the near-miner nodes a bunch of very low feerate transactions which won't get mined soon . He concurrently sends conflicting high feerate transactions to every other node.  The high feerate transactions don't get mined, the other nodes have no idea why,  and they bleed bandwidth continually uselessly re-advertising transactions. (if the higher feerate txn gets mined by accident he just tries again)\r\n\r\nIf erlay style relay is used, the bandwidth is really only wasted at the low/high feerate boundary... but unfortunately the attacker can make that boundary arbitrarily large (e.g. give half the nodes the low feerate txn in additional to all the miner-proximal nodes).\r\n",

    "body": "thank you for your review @gmaxwell !\r\n\r\nRE: kill switch & `-walletbroadcast=0`\r\n- This mechanism previously disabled rebroadcasts, since that was a purely wallet focused responsibility. With these changes (in the current state), setting this flag to false will not disable the node rebroadcasting transactions. \r\n- Conceptually I think this makes sense. with these changes rebroadcasting transactions is more of a p2p/mempool responsibility. Disabling wallet broadcast shouldn\u2019t disable rebroadcasting.\r\n- `-blocksonly` mode would disable rebroadcast because there would be no txns in the mempool (unless you submit locally) \r\n- I\u2019m planning to add another flag to disable rebroadcast specifically. This can also be used for rollout, and nodes can choose to enable the new logic to verify reasonable behavior. \r\n\r\nRE: handling dependencies \r\nfor the reasons you mentioned I use `addPackageTx` for calculating top of mempool. \r\n\r\n> Has anyone considered significantly increasing the time between rebroadcasts as an additional change (and one that could go in separately much faster)\r\n\r\nI have not. That\u2019s a great idea. I'm going to create a smaller PR with the mempool logic that guarantees delivery of wallet transactions & reduce frequency of rebroadcasts in the existing implementation. Thank you!\r\n\r\n> This sort of concern would be substantially mitigated by not rebroadcasting as soon as the transaction is \u2018missed\u2019 but only after it is missed by N blocks (say 3) blocks \u2026\r\n\r\nYeah. For these sorts of reason there are impositions on the rebroadcast set (mainly txn must be >30 mins old. block must have arrived between last cache run and rebroadcast ). Still an open question whether the params chosen are the most reasonable.\r\n\r\nRE: bandwidth \r\n\r\nYup and yup. `filterInventoryKnown` hugely decreases the inv messages sent to peers in the normal cases. But average bandwidth usage is insufficient for accepting these changes, simply just one aspect. \r\n\r\nThe attack you\u2019ve portrayed here is in line with the open question I\u2019ve been pondering about mempools with different policies - the non-adversarial case you\u2019ve mentioned.  The solution I\u2019m thinking about is adding another data structure, `max_rebroadcast_count` that would maintain txids, expiry times, and count (number of times I have rebroadcasted). Over a certain count, it would serve as a rebroadcast blacklist. If the txn is mined into a block it would be removed from the list, still have to think through the other expiry conditions. I\u2019m still hammering out the details but would be interested in hearing your feedback. \r\n\r\n> Question: Is it a goal to rebroadcast transactions to peers that have already had them sent to them?\r\n\r\nHm, somewhere in between? The goal of rebroadcasting transactions is to propagate a transaction out to the network in your mempool that you suspect the miners might not have. If you\u2019ve recently sent a txn to a peer, you don\u2019t have reason to believe resending it to them would help solve this issue, and would just waste bandwidth. On the other hand, you would want to rebroadcast to the same peers in eg. a situation where you have a large mempool, your peers have small mempools & a competitive fee rate market caused them to drop a transaction. After the fee pressure reduces, re-announcing the txn to them could help it get mined. In its current form, the bloom filter is conducive to this behavior by preventing repeat sends to a peer within a ~2-6 hr time period (including txns dropped from the mempool). \r\n\r\nRE: alternative peer-transaction tracking system\r\n\r\nI\u2019m definitely interested in thinking through this approach you\u2019re proposing / other alternatives to the current bloom filter, but think its tangential to this PR? Would be happy to continue the convo on a new issue if you\u2019re interested in opening.",

This makes it easier to guess from the variable name if something is a member, a global, or just  a symbol in the local scope. Additionally, I'd prefer to use `std::chrono::seconds` (or whatever the type is) for those reasons:\r\n\r\n* It documents the type for reviewers\r\n* It enforces the type at compile time and prevents unwanted casts\r\n* It documents that the time is mockable. (I know that the memepool currently is mockable and uses the legacy `GetTime()` function and types, but at least new code should use the new `GetTime<>()` functions and types.)",

I will add a comment to document.\r\n\r\nthis logic should only trigger when a user submits a txn locally and it doesn't get initially relayed..  an example where this would be needed.. a user submits a low fee rate txn with p2p disabled, inspects it in the local mempool, and enables p2p. currently, the txn would get initially relayed due to the wallet rebroadcast logic. with the proposed changes (w/out this additional mempool-force-relays-unbroadcast-txns mechansim), the node could have to be running at a pretty specific time (when the mempool is clearing out and mining low fee rate txns) in order for the txn to ever initially get broadcast. thus, `setInventoryTxToSend`. \r\n\r\nIn terms of privacy guarantees (or lack thereof) it mimics the current behavior. If you have any suggestions for how we could improve while preserving the propagation guarantees, I'm all ears :) ",

While it is possible to guess whether a list of INVs is a rebroadcast inv or not, it shouldn't be possible to trivially find the source of the low feerate txs in that inv. Txs broadcast for the first time from our node should be no different from txs broadcast for the first time from another node to us and then relayed by us. It is know to not be perfect (see dandelion tx relay), but improving that seems like a separate issue to me.",

    "body": "Want to clarify my expectations of the behavior- \r\n\r\nWe add transactions to `setInventoryTxToSend` when we expect to relay the transaction to a peer. This includes if we are the source node for the transaction as well as if we are relaying it. With these changes, both the transactions to rebroadcast and the \"unbroadcast\" transactions are added to `setInventoryTxToSend` on the rebroadcast poisson timer. \r\n\r\nLater, all transactions from `setInventoryTxToSend` get added to `vInvTx`, passed through some checks, then relayed to peers. \r\n\r\nSo, what this means... \r\n* if they are keeping track, peers can detect rebroadcast transactions because `INV` messages have been sent for that transaction before. \r\n* `INVs` for unbroadcast transactions have probably not been sent out before (unless all the peers who received the message did not send a `GETDATA` back). \r\n* In the normal case, the peer would not be able to distinguish a transaction sent from the unbroadcast set from a transaction being submitted initially, or the initial relay. This is known to be imperfect, but these changes should not make privacy worse than current behavior. \r\n* The only new potential for privacy leak that I see based on these changes- \r\nA node disables p2p, creates a transaction, enables p2p. At that time, that transaction gets propagated out to the network due to being on the unbroadcast set. The first peer the node sends an `INV` to is the attacker. The attacker is able to send back a `GETDATA` before any other `INV` messages are sent out. The attacker does not relay the transaction to any other nodes.\r\nTime passes, the node calculates the transaction \"should have been mined\" by now, puts it into the rebroadcast set, relays it out to its peers. The attacker has another connection open to the node & is able to identify that it is a rebroadcast. The attacker would also have to have many other nodes & connections to the rest of the network to identify that this is the only node rebroadcasting that transaction. This seems pretty difficult to execute, definitely harder to discern source node based on rebroadcast logic than in the existing implementation. \r\n* In this case, the much bigger concern would be the ability of an attacker to stop the propagation of a transaction by sending the `GETDATA` back very quickly, thus removing it from the node's unbroadcast set. I'm trying to better understand the risk of this & brainstorm possible better solutions (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#discussion_r348840194). If any reviewers have thoughts or questions about this mechanism, let's continue the convo on that thread. \r\n\r\n@mzumsande to conclude this long explanation, hopefully this resolves your original question? The unbroadcast set should have (pretty much) the same guarantees as initial relay. LMK if you have any outstanding questions or recommendations for improved documentation. ",

    "body": "Reducing mempool does not obviously help with resource reduction for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1) because of compact blocks (slower to get new blocks, so if you're peak-bandwidth capped it's bad).\r\n2) If you're bandwidth constrained, you aren't necessarily memory constrained either (why throw away a transaction if it seems good?)\r\n3) It stands to reason that when fees are going up, you'll evict a lot of stuff from your mempool as newer txns go in, and when the fees go back down you'll need stuff re-relayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I'd just like to understand how this does impact bandwidth usage, it seemed to not be a non trivial amount more as it's 1/f * block size * period * #peers more data volume? If it's actually small then so be it. But it does seem, to me, to be non-negligible",

    "body": "I'm unable to reproduce this locally. Asked @jonatack for logs & looks like the failure occurs after going through the while loop >150 times, which means the `if new_conn.get_invs()` conditional is never hitting. Theoretically it would be possible for the condition to not hit, but that should be an _extreme_ edge case, vs the frequency of failures being seen. I'll try to run this test in different environments to see if I can reproduce. ",

    "body": "I agree that its not an ideal separation of concerns, but I think it's reasonable. Essentially, when you submit a txn to the mempool/node, it guarantees that it will 1. validate the txn & accept into its mempool locally & 2. propagate it out to the network (assuming validity). \r\n\r\nThe normal way this is achieved is by bundling the actions together. However, if you have p2p disabled when you initially submit the txn, you no longer get # 2. \r\n\r\nPreviously, this wasn't an issue because the rebroadcast logic was so over-eager, that initial relay would automatically occur within a short amount of time after enabling p2p. With these changes, that is no longer a guarantee, so we need to explicitly keep track of the transactions that have passed step # 1, but not yet # 2. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be that the mempool returns indication when the txn was accepted locally & then when the txn was propagated to the network. Then the entity submitting the txn (wallet, third-party RPC, whatever) would have to keep track of txns in the in-between state. I think thats a much messier interaction between the layers. ",

I think this point is really linked with wallet timer rebroadcast, if you reduce it to be under the mempool one, won't you be sure than your txn is going to be initially broadcast at least within 1 hour ?\r\n\r\n> The other option would be that the mempool returns indication when the txn was accepted locally & then when the txn was propagated to the network. Then the entity submitting the txn (wallet, third-party RPC, whatever) would have to keep track of txns in the in-between state. I think thats a much messier interaction between the layers.\r\n\r\nIf a wallet gets notification of transaction mempool insertion it should rely on it for network propagation but mempool may fail for its own internal reasons (size, conflicts) so for reliability your wallet should ensure periodic resend/rebroadcast.\r\n  ",

I explained the reason that it makes sense for the node to keep track of txns that are being initially relayed, let me know if you have further questions. I believe I have addressed your concerns around the timers elsewhere on this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm going to resolve this conversation.

    "body": "Seems like the customizable rebroadcast interval is a proposed solution for concerns around bandwidth usage for low resourced nodes. \r\n\r\nI agree that we should ensure these rebroadcast changes don\u2019t impose a significant bandwidth requirement.\r\n\r\nI believe the current changes require little additional bandwidth, which my initial monitoring from running this patch supports. More info posted in the main comment [thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#issuecomment-570838774). \r\n\r\nBut this is not conclusive for determining that bandwidth impact is low in all conditions. If further monitoring leads to deciding we need to restrict resource usage further, we have options. For the fingerprint reasons mentioned above I don't think a customizable rebroadcast interval makes the most sense. However, we could consider a kill switch to disable rebroadcast all together (along the lines of current implementation walletbroadcast=0). Also available (and probably the first line of experimentation) would be tinkering with the params to tighten the txns selected for rebroadcast.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve updated my [gist](https://gist.github.com/amitiuttarwar/b592ee410e1f02ac0d44fcbed4621dba#open-questions--solutions) with this open questions & possible solutions and moving forward will maintain it with the options & latest thinking. \r\n\r\nSince this comment thread is about customizable rebroadcast intervals, I'm going to resolve the conversation. But let's continue to discuss bandwidth impact in the main PR thread as I continue to monitor & share data. \r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin let me know what you think. esp if you disagree or have any questions.
