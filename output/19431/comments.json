Or how could we change packages in the future if the cache never gets invalidated?\r\n\r\nIt is/was a juggling act. On my fork I have an [appveyor-force-refresh](https://github.com/sipsorcery/bitcoin/blob/appveyor-force-refresh/.appveyor.yml) branch (bit out of date now) that uses `Exit-AppveyorBuild` after the dependencies are installed that exits the job before the build solely to get the dependency cache set. After that run I'd switch back to `master` and do the build with the dependencies already in the cache.\r\n\r\n> If a build times out, why would there be any time to upload the cache? I think APPVEYOR_SAVE_CACHE_ON_ERROR refers to a build or test error, not a timeout.\r\n\r\nYes you are right my mistake. As per above I used to have to exit the job early to avoid a timeout in order to get the cache updated.\r\n\r\n> Interestingly the first passing build with the invalidated cache took the same time to build as it takes other builds to run, so maybe the cache is not needed after all?\r\n\r\nFrom a quick look at the appveyor job history there was a spike of jobs rebuilding the `vcpkg` dependencies. I suspect, but didn't verify, that a PR changed the `build_msvc\\vcpkg-packages.txt` file and thereby invalidated the `C:\\tools\\vcpkg\\installed` cache entry. The subsequent PR most likely had the original packages file causing it to also invalidate the cache.\r\n\r\nThe following jobs all use the `vcpkg` cache WITHOUT re-generating:\r\n\r\n - `master.22376` 45:21\r\n - `master.22375` 44:19\r\n - `master.22374` 45:27\r\n - `master.22373` 45:51\r\n\r\nThese jobs DID rebuild the `vcpkg` dependencies:\r\n\r\n - `master.22370` 60:04\r\n - `master.22369` 60:03\r\n - `master.22368` 60:02\r\n\r\nSo a consistent 15 minute difference if `vcpkg` dependencies need to be rebuilt. Also the Bitcoin Core appveyor jobs do seem to have more resources than free/personal appveyor accounts. My own appveyor account can't build + test Bitcoin core in under an hour even with the dependencies in the cache.\r\n\r\nBut I know where you're coming from, caches are always a pain precisely because of issues like this. I was obviously a bit melodramatic when I said all builds will fail if this PR is merged. The builds referenced above show they are still passing even when the `vcpkg` dependencies are rebuilt, they just take 15 minutes longer.\r\n\r\nI guess if the cache is causing issues AND the build can still be done under the appveyor time limit it does make sense to remove it. Waiting an hour for a CI job seems like it's too long but if there's a queue of jobs an extra 15 minutes is not noticeable. It would mean free/personal appveyor accounts are unlikely to ever be able to use this script successfully but that's the case now any way.\r\n\r\n",
