    "body": "It did fix the problem it was intended to which was the failing build on the most recent appveyor Visual Studio 2019 image...\r\n\r\nThe reason for the appveyor failure on this PR was hitting the 1hr limit (previously appveyor seemed to let the Bitcoin Core jobs run over the 1 hr a bit, I saw some up to 1h 14, look like that's been tightened up).\r\n\r\nAnd after that there's about a 25% chance the python functional tests will fail.\r\n\r\nTo put it In leveldb terms I was using the `narrow` definition of `fix`.\r\n\r\nBut in seriousness switching to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17697) is looking more appealing if Appveyor are enforcing the 1hr limit. It's a real pain to juggle the Appveyor job to get the vcpkg's installed, force a failure to update the cache, then re-run the job to do that actual build. GitHub Actions don't have the 1hr limit... Admittedly Github Actions do have a 100% failure rate on the python functional tests but if we want them to be reliable on either Windows based CI they need work any way.",
