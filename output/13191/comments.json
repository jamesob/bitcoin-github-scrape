I'd like to keep it around for a bit and see if I can adapt it to use multi-way instead, in which case it could be used for everything. I can also move it and move it back if used. What do you think?\r\n\r\n@Kick1986 AVX512 is cool, but it's low-impact (even machines that support it right now do it with reduced clock rate), and I'm unable to benchmark it.

You need to schedule multiple variable length things in groups of 64 bytes, interspersed with padding. Not going to do that in this PR. Also, @jl2012 suggested writing an optimized 32-byte-input single-SHA256 for use in the second half of double-SHA256 computations, which could help there as well.",
