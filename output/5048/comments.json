    "body": "Right, it's easier if the write is atomic (otherwise you'll need to have a separate catch up function to rebuild the index if it's out of date with the chainstate, and as it's always going to be updated in lockstep with the chainstate on disk, better make it part of it).\n\nOne way would be to have CCoinsViewDB take a reference/pointer to a map with extra index entries to write, and have BatchWrite serialize those as well. That's not particularly clean, and it's pretty inconvenient to query as well.\n\nIt seems there is not really a better way than to make this part of the CCoinsView framework. I just wished we could keep optional features out of the consensus code...\n",

With the other index you can query all transactions involving the address. \n\nOf course with getrawtransaction you can also query the transaction which created the unspent output, but you can not query the transaction history for an address with this index. Only the current \"balance\" basically.\n\nDepending on your use-case, this index may be all you need. But if you care about transaction history, you still need the other index.

I've been looking at it and chatting with @gmaxwell about it, and it seems like it might be related to using 'tx' in CTxMemPool::remove after it's been invalidated.\n\nIn particular, it looks to me like tx is always a reference into mapNextTx, and my understanding is that if we reference it after performing _any_ removal from mapNextTx -- which does happen -- we run the risk that our reference will become invalid (e.g. if mapNextTx undergoes a resize due to the removal.)\n\nIt looks like the other code in the function carefully avoids touching tx after removing from mapNextTx. (Also, at HEAD the remove function has been rewritten to be non-recursive, and is even more careful in how it uses the value of tx, which is now origTx.)\n\nIt looks to me like it might be sufficient (in both the old and new versions of remove) just to move your code to the top of remove(), but I'm just eyeballing that and you should not take my word for it.\n",

And we're erasing the transaction from mapTx, and then later accessing it. So the new code just needs to be moved above the place where we remove the transaction from mapTx thus invalidating our reference to it.\n",

Quite long, but better IMO. Or maybe this one should be the RPC command, not command line argument. What do you think?\n\nOr the other way. Make it all RPC commands: `txoutbyaddress true` and `... false`. And use the index automatically when it is built.\n",

    "body": "Agree with @jgarzik, it's not fair to keep this lingering for too long.\n\nI like the use case it solves, but I still dislike the degree to which it's entangled with the CCoinsView. I think this feature should be something that is independent, rather than complicating the code necessary for its core function.\n\nWould it be reasonable to implement it as a separate database file, and have it function like the wallet? Something that registers with CValidationInterface, and listens for new transactions being added (and removed) from the blockchain. It could store its own CBlockLocator (like the wallet does, triggered by CValidationInterface's SetBestChain) so it can \"rescan\" like the wallet does too.\n\nA by-script index for the mempool could be done separately, using an extra index added after #6470's multiindex for the mempool?\n",

As you may have noticed, I am not contributing to this project anymore, because I disagree with basically anything here and I am doing something else now.  If anybody wants to pick this up, feel free to just copy and paste from my code.\n\nOff-topic:\nI disagree with most code changes you guys are making. For example main.cpp was much more readable in 0.8 than it is now. Or libconsensus. You guys are very good low-level coders, but you seriously have zero understanding of what encapsulation of problems is. (hint: its not moving code to another file) You are actually making the source code worse in my opinion. \n\nYou havent merged my wallet-pulls, which I consider as important bug-fixes because the wallet-performance is just a bug. Instead you consider moving code around as more important. Long-term goal is to remove GUI and wallet even.\n\nAnd last but not least, the block size. It is your responsibility to give people the latest in technology. This includes scale. Your job here is to max out the block size.  This is like if your job is to make a 20000 people stadium full and you only let 1000 people in, with the argument that you can never satisfy demand anyway.\n\nYou are acting like, if we go higher than 1MB, then suddenly everybody has to fully trust the miners. The threshold to rent a server for a day and verify all blocks to not be affordable to normal people is very much higher than 1MB.\n\nI believe we need different people in the lead position here to be successful. At least gavin should \nbe back on the throne with final say on really everything.\n\nSo sorry, but long-term I have given up on the project. I am still following a little, so if there are maintanance things for my code, feel free to contact.\n",

    "body": "I'm sorry you feel that way, and I understand the sentiment also partially.\n\nI agree moving code to another file is not proper encapsulation, but some\nof the time, moving is a first step, and an easily reviewable one.\nEspecially the separation of consensus code is not something we want to do\nwithout very high assurances behaviour does not change. I think we are\nmaking progress, but it is admittedly slow.\n\nMy only suggestion above here was a more encapsulated approach, by the way,\nnot a NAK...\n\nRegarding total complexity: I fully agree the code is not \"nice\". It wasn't\nnice when Satoshi disappeared, and it still isn't. Significant parts have\nbeen properly encapsulated since (script execution, addrman, wallet, UTXO\nmanagement, network base, UI interaction, limited size data structures),\nbut at the same time, the code definitely has grown too. I believe that was\nnecessary: higher performance often means the problem becomes more complex\n(for example the introduction of caches, batch processing, precomputed\nvalues, ...). I often very much wish to rewrite everything in a clean way,\nbut that's just not something that would be reviewable.\n\nAbout your wallet patches not being merged: I'm aware. But the truth is\nthat there is little interest in the wallet code, from both users and\ndevelopers. We need people who are interested in reviewing and testing to\nmake changes. That of course leads to the wallet code growing more and more\noutdated, reinforcing that circle. One solution to this may be\n@jonasschnelli's new wallet project, which aims to add a new expiremental\nwallet from scratch, which would be more competitive in features.\n\nRegarding block size: please discuss that on the mailing list. As a Bitcoin\nCore maintainer, I believe we should merge any consensus change that\nappears uncontroversial to the community.\n",
