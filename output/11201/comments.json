    "body": "Well there is already a recommend way to do this: use a block proposal.\r\n\r\nThe general limitation with a 'verifyrawtransaction' approach is that it doesn't let you test a graph of unconfirmed transactions, but a block proposal does.\r\n\r\nLooks like internally your rpc is doing more or less what a block proposal does, but handling more of the things around it. So perhaps it would be useful to do.\r\n\r\nIt could obviously be extended to accept an array of transactions to do the right thing with respect to multiple... but another open question is what about parents in the mempool. Right now your code will fail a transaction that spends the output of a mempool transaction.  Sometimes that would be desirable but I think often not. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks much for that link @jtimon, somehow I missed that.\r\n\r\nIt seems like everyone agrees that there is the potential for some useful functionality here, there's just some uncertainty in what exactly the API for this should look like. After reading https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7552, it seems like this uncertainty is largely what has kept `verifyrawtransaction` functionality from being included in the past.\r\n\r\nWhat if `verifyrawtransaction` became `verifyrawtransactions` as in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7552, and took an argument as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"transactions\": [ \"hex_tx0\", \"hex_tx1\", ... ],\r\n    \"use_local_policy\": true // default true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this achieves all of the behavior we want; users can set \"use_local_policy\" to false if they only want to check consensus rules. I will also make it handle ancestors in the mempool correctly as brought up by @gmaxwell, unless that should be another flag?\r\n\r\nI think I can do a lot of this with a minor refactor of `AcceptToMemoryPoolWorker`.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound good?",

    "body": "@justicz Thanks for working on this.  I think there's still work to be done here, but this seems like a promising direction.\r\n\r\nRather than add the `dryRunMap` to the mempool, though, I think it'd be cleaner if we instead just added a caching layer in front of the mempool, which holds these dry run transactions.  ATMPWorker already takes a mempool as an argument, so I think it'd be straightforward to abstract the mempool interface away (and I guess clean up the mempool interface so that callers aren't grabbing at internals), and then pass in a cache that holds dry run transactions in it, as well as transactions that get evicted from the mempool (eg due to RBF).  Then I think we could ensure that the mempool itself is a const object in this context that is clearly unaffected, with all changes happening only in the cache.\r\n\r\nIf we can achieve that, that would make the review and maintenance burden of this feature pretty minimal, which I think would be awesome.",
