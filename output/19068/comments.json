    "body": "Pushed a few more removals, updated the descriptors and fixed whitespace.\r\n\r\n> Is there any \"official\" mac documention or user surveys that suggest which one is the recommended or preferred way?\r\n\r\nThe Apple documentation is mainly focused on using Xcode and App Store distribution: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devac02c5ab8. There is a section on distribution outside the App Store: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev033e997ca, however I couldn't quickly find any mention of using `.dmg`s. There are some instructions on \"macOS installer packages\" (`.pkg`): https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve51ce7c3d.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be at least some companies that are using a combination of `.dmg` and `.zip` for distribution. i.e: [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) is distributed as a `.zip`, while [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a `.dmg`.\r\n\r\n> Just the symlink should get us close enough to the original UX.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any projects that are using a symlink inside a `.zip` approach. The Bitcoin Core GUI is mostly [designed for power users of bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395#issuecomment-550339984), and I think the intersection of power users, and people who don't know how to handle a `.zip` file would be very small. \r\n\r\nAlso, as far as I'm aware, you can open and use an app bundle from any directory on macOS, and it makes  little to no difference to how the app actually runs?",

    "body": "> I'm not aware of any projects that are using a symlink inside a .zip approach\r\n\r\nThat's because most projects use a DMG with a symlink and background image. We have a good reason to avoid that, namely to make deterministic builds easier. Even as an experienced macOS user, I find the symlink useful; it saves me from opening a new Finder window, navigating to Applications and then dragging between two windows. And it's a trivial thing to add.\r\n\r\n> Also, as far as I'm aware, you can open and use an app bundle from any directory on macOS, and it makes little to no difference to how the app actually runs?\r\n\r\nWhenever I deal with applications that don't have an installer or a symlink, I very often make the mistake of running it from the Download folder. That works, until I accidentally clean up the download folder. There's no obvious alternative folder to drag the program to.\r\n\r\nWhen downloading an upgrade there's an additional risk that a user doesn't replace the original version. The first time they might double click on the download and run the new version. Second time they might use command + space and launch the old version.",
