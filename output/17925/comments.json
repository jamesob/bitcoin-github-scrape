    "body": "Apologies, that was an offline discussion!\r\n\r\nfirst_seen or FirstSeen is no good for this use case. If you negate visited then you impose that callers of visited has to check the negation of the call or to nest the code a level deeper inside an if, which adds more cognitive overhead IMO. Most of the code that I've written uses an `if (visited(it)) continue;` guard to check the next element, this code becomes less readable with `if (!first_seen(x)) continue;` or if (first_seen(it)) { x }`\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend reading this issue on style nits and whatnot: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15465; I don't think it's unreasonable to try to figure out better tweaks to names or whatnot, but I think as long as the code is clear & we can convince ourselves it's correct in review, that's more or less sufficient for moving on.\r\n",

(Also, as this would be the first introduction of epochs in the code, it'd be helpful for reviewers of the future PRs that will use it in more places to be able to remember/understand what this construction is.)

In some places we use std::set (or setEntries) to deduplicate\r\n what we visit, but we can do (algorithmically) better by using a counter (\"epoch\") that \r\nwe set on each transaction and comparing against a global epoch to track whether \r\nwe've visited something already during a calculation.\r\n```\r\nOr something like that...",

You could imagine a use for this if I wanted to walk the whole mempool and traverse every connected component once, but at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis requires some modified behavior (e.g., making epoch guards aware of the epoch they are guarding), but can still work.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst auto epoch = GetFreshEpoch();\r\nfor (auto& elt : mapTx) {\r\n    if (epoch.visited(elt)) continue;\r\n    const auto epoch = epoch.SubEpoch();\r\n    vector<txiter> component;\r\n    GetAllAncestorsEpochAlreadyHeld(elt, component);\r\n    GetAllDescendentsEpochAlreadyHeld(elt, component);\r\n    DoSomethingWithComponent(component);\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "Things like needs_processing aren't great because there can be some sort of implication that it2 needs processing after it's been marked, and doesn't convey the action. What it is a bit better for is conveying the optionality aspect (something that's an nullopt doesn't need processing).\r\n\r\nThe reason we liked visited as a name is that there is a hint that it's not idempotent, that visited suggests both a query (was it2 visited already?) and a statement (it2 has been visited now).\r\n\r\nUltimately a names just a name, and I don't think visited is horribly unclear. If visited isn't sufficient of a name, I'd opt for removing the optional version of this function (as previously noted it's unused) and just inlining the optional handling where it's used (although it wouldn't quite be the same because of the guard assertion checks).\r\n\r\n(One of the other reasons for introducing this PR now rather than later by the way is that there are two or more separate places in the code presently that use Optional txiters, introducing this in a common PR means that those changes can proceed independently of one another.)",
