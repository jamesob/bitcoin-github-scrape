Like if they get an error and just try again, hoping to get different inputs -- but if they don't have enough utxo's they get the same result, a transaction eating up space in their wallet which has been abandoned.  That seems like a bad outcome as well....  I'm not sure if a problem like this is unique to this approach but I'm generally wary of promoting more use of `AbandonTransaction()`; in general I feel like that should be for emergencies only.  I think to implement something like this behavior it would make more sense to add a way to remove a transaction from the wallet.\r\n",

Beyond that, the UTXOs are hidden from the user when selecting coins, and the user will simply not be able to add to the chain anymore.\r\n\r\n> I also think that in the future we may want to build more wallet features around the idea of, say, starting with a low fee (which may not make it into the mempool) and then auto-fee-bumping according to some schedule until it gets confirmed. So I wouldn't want to preclude these kinds of strategies.\r\n\r\nIf it's so low it doesn't make it into the mempool, what is the purpose of the transaction existing at all? It will never make it into the mempool as is, so you could just as well abandon it in favor of the higher-fee variant that comes along later. Again, I may be missing some subtlety here.\r\n\r\nEdit: I had missed one subtlety: that abandoned transactions are kept in the wallet. It would make more sense to discard completely in these cases, but not sure if that's possible.",
