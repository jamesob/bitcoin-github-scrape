RIP BIP 9.\"\r\n\r\nThe outline of the various proposals used BIP 8 rather than BIP 9: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Taproot_activation_proposals\r\n\r\nAnd various media articles reporting on the discussion referred to BIP 8 rather than BIP 9.\r\n\r\nThough I don't expect it to scupper the momentum this promising proposal is generating if people want to call this BIP 9 (or do mental gymnastics by opening a new BIP) please be clear on why it doesn't fit within the template of BIP 8.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I am delighted with the progress this proposal is making and having a PR up in such quick time really is great, so many thanks for your work on this.\r\n\r\nedit: Thinking about this more I don't think it would be mental gymnastics to open a new BIP for \"Speedy trial\" especially if it doesn't fit cleanly into a more flexible BIP 8. New BIP or more flexible BIP 8. BIP 9 is dead and if \"Speedy trial\" could be used for other soft forks it shouldn't be included in the Taproot BIPs.",

    "body": "Concept ACK.  Thank you, @ajtowns!  I'm happy to see that the change really is minimal.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly from reading the code that activation will occur in the first block of the next retarget period after the `activation_time`?  E.g., if the minimum activation time just passed but the height is 1234, the first block where taproot's rules are enforced still won't be until height 2016?  That seems fine to me for the sake of code simplicity, but it does mean that, if it looks like `activation_time` is going to fall near a retarget block, we'll have to communicate that taproot could either happen tomorrow or two weeks from now.  Maybe to avoid that communication challenge, it'd be better to use a height?\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson \r\n\r\n> I don't know (though I can guess) why people are trying to refer to BIP 9 now instead of BIP 8, especially as height based activation seems the superior option.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [my email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html), I thought basing the proposal on the existing BIP9 code in Bitcoin Core (as done in this PR) would be the smallest change and so fastest to get reviewed, merged, and released.  Since the goal of the Speedy Trial proposal is speed (with safety), that seems highly advantageous to me.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that using block heights for the `start` and `timeout` parameters has advantages for this proposal (giving miners a known number of signaling periods) and that, as also mentioned in my email, getting BIP8 included in the code now would have advantages if Speedy Trial fails and we decide to use BIP8 as originally imagined for a follow-up activation attempt.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for whatever solution is most preferred by reviewers.",

However I'm not convinced we should permanently drop the BIP9 threshold to 90%.\r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin wrote:\r\n\r\n> merging this now is a concrete step, patching to use height can occur independently\r\n\r\nI'm fine with a height based approach too; slightly more code changes, but it seems easier to communicate when things happen. I also agree with Jeremy's point. Nothing here is set in stone until we actually apply it to Taproot (or another soft fork).\r\n\r\nThere is one downside though, in addition to more review work: other implementations probably already have BIP 9 code ready to go. Although compared to implementing all of Taproot this is not a big deal (and without implementing Taproot they can't verify the new consensus rules anyway). \r\n\r\n> Making the case for BIP8 merge first then these changes, the BIP8 code is much more reviewed presently (with no code nacks, just conceptual ones?)\r\n\r\nFor me that's only an option if the `LOT=true` stuff is stripped from that PR.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem terribly complicated to cherry-pick 9762562cc6a2c771ad0ddfb055ea17b90085425c, bcec418304ea3dd524cb3591e4af1b77a04cc968 (though I suggest a fresh BIP for the speedy trial) and a few more.",

    "body": "> but it does mean that, if it looks like `activation_time` is going to fall near a retarget block, we'll have to communicate that taproot could either happen tomorrow or two weeks from now.\r\n\r\nI think it's worse than that -- if `activation_time` falls very near a retarget block, I think you could have the eleven last blocks of the retarget period have timestamps (relative to `activation_time`) like:  `-3000, -2400, -1800, -1200, -600, 0, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000` giving the last block a median time which satisfies `MedianTimePast() >= activation_time`, so the next block would switch to ACTIVE and people would likely start transacting with taproot, perhaps even racing to get a tx in the first block as some did with segwit, and setting nlocktime to ensure their transaction isn't mined early and the funds stolen.\r\n\r\nHowever in that case a 2 block reorg could change the last block's timestamp to `-400` (still greater than the mediantime of the prior block which is likely -600), which would change its median time from `0` to `-400`, which would then cause the new first block of the next period to still be in state LOCKED_IN. At that point replaying the taproot-using transactions people had sent prior to the reorg would allow funds to be stolen as taproot is not yet active after the reorg, and nlocktime would not have protected you.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: fixed mediantime rules misinterpretation -- blocks must have a timestamp greater than the previous block's mediantime; block's mediantime does include their own timestamp. And add the following...)\r\n\r\nI think the conclusion from this is just \"the height at which you transition from LOCKED_IN to ACTIVE must be fully determined as soon as you transition from STARTED to LOCKED_IN\". That way the entire LOCKED_IN period has to be reorged if you want to steal funds protected by both nlocktime and the new rules.",

    "body": "I have a preference for fully height based design, correct. But I think that given the code base as it stands today, and comparing the diffs across the PR, and the tight timeline desired from merge to release using MTP really is a decent option, especially since the bulk of the code is already more widely tested. Longer term it makes sense to fully develop and test height based -- whether we do that, I don't know.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke's comment is a slight misunderstanding I believe of how the fuzzer simulates time; I recall AJ saying (somewhere) that block times are steady interval in the fuzzing so that it doesn't matter (can't find that comment now tho). Is that correct?\r\n\r\nI also emphasized numerous times in the meeting that I think for the purposes of a 3 month ST, forecasting to be a mid-period start/stopheight means that drift is very unlikely to hurt us, so the notion that we're \"risking two periods\" is a bit moot to me.\r\n\r\nThe counterarguments can be made that we have bigger issues to solve for if we miss two periods as a result of a hashrate decrease (where did the hashrate go -- we probably wouldn't want to activate if we're missing a big chunk of hashrate contemporaneously anyways) and that on the flip side, a hashrate increase would yield in the block heights going by more quickly which means there is less real time to coordinate enabling signaling. There are pros and cons either way, I think that height is superior longer term, but in this case I don't think there is sufficient technical risk to disqualify this PR as an activation method in favor of start/stop height.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr I would appreciate if you could justify your concept NACK more explicitly as I do not understand your concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar made a great point in the meeting\r\n> my two cents: I don't think either PR is close to being RFM, both need significantly more review. looks like #21392 is currently failing CI. If the goal is to quickly merge with safety, I think #21377 makes more sense (as I stated on the PR)\r\n\r\nRough consensus and running code -- it seems to me that this is closer to a mergeable state. If there's a strong reason to the contrary, or if people decide to invest the requisite energy to get #21392 reviewed and RTM before then ok.",

    "body": "> Ideally, height-based locked_in parameters would be better, as consensus rules around MTP are quite loose. AFAIU, it doesn't prevent a coalition of miners to scale down their mined blocks `nTime` to MTP + 1, thus preventing to reach a bip9 starttime at the expected real-world time\r\n\r\nSince it uses median time past, you'd need to be doing that for 6 out of every 11 blocks, which would require >50% of hashpower, and you'd have to take care to not manipulate the nTime of the first and last block of each retarget period so as not to make difficulty skyrocket; but you'd only need 10% of hashpower to block signalling.\r\n\r\nLosing hashpower was the concern for MTP with bip148, and it could be a theoretical concern here too -- if you lost 75% of hashpower, then instead of 14 weeks between timeout and starttime resulting in 6 or 7 retarget periods, it could result in just 1 or 2 retarget periods. But provided no new rules are added to cause blocks to be considered invalid (such as the required signalling rule in bip148), there's no reason to expect a drastic loss of hashpower.\r\n\r\nBut as you point out, in any event, we'd learn something new, and could try again afterwards taking that new knowledge into account.",

Although AJ has done as much as anyone to advance Taproot activation with all sorts of contributions (conceptual, code, tests, fuzzing) I am at a loss as to why to choose a PR with a mix of block height and MTP over a [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21392) with a consistent use of block height.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to summarize the discussion on block height versus mix of block height and MTP [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/103854/should-block-height-or-mtp-or-a-mixture-of-both-be-used-in-a-soft-fork-activatio). To me a consistent use of block height is a no brainer. If that needs a little more review and testing so be it. (I'm not convinced it does btw, I find it much easier to reason and think about edge cases with entirely block height than a mixture. It is a slightly larger code diff, that is true.)\r\n\r\nI also have no idea why block height versus mix of block height and MTP has any impact whatsoever on UASF plans. It doesn't seem to impact the difficulty of implementing a competing compatible UASF and any possible \"marketing\" gain for a UASF seems illusory.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I have been happy to work on a UASF project in the recent past when there seemed little chance of progress with Taproot activation in Core. I would also consider doing so again in future depending on the circumstances.\r\n\r\nI hope we can choose a Speedy Trial PR as soon as possible to focus all review effort on it. If this PR is chosen over Andrew's PR I will disagree with that decision but I will live with it. I think it will be the inferior choice (assuming a new rationale isn't explained to me) but I don't think it will cause any material problems with activation.\r\n",

While I agree that MTP is conceptually easier to work with, practically it has many edge cases and gotchas that I don't think we should continue forward with using MTP.

    "body": "@ajtowns \r\n\r\n> Transitions go from STARTED to DELAYED to LOCKED_IN to ACTIVE, with LOCKED_IN not being entered until MTP passes min_lock_in_time. This fixes the problem noted earlier while retaining] the ability to know 2016 blocks in advance when activation will occur.\r\n\r\nI like that.  I think it does a better job of communicating to users what state the deployment is in and, by virtue of `min_lock_in_time` being a time, gives a more reliable and easier to understand estimate of when activation will happen (e.g. \"`min_lock_in_time` + 10 - 24 days with high confidence\" instead of using heights, where it could be as much as \"140 to 220 days\").\r\n\r\n> Adds an optional parameter to -vbparams to allow testing, and uses that parameter in the unit tests.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n@achow101 \r\n\r\n> it seems like this PR has gotten more complicated due to MTP\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed both (as of last week), I thought this was moderately simpler than yours.  I skimmed the rebase diff and don't think the last push increases complexity (indeed, I think it simplifies it from the earlier `minimum_activation_height` change.\r\n\r\n> MTP [...] practically has many edge cases and gotchas [and] I don't think we should continue forward with using MTP. Heights are strictly easier to understand.\r\n\r\nWhat edge cases does MTP have for a deployment such as this where there's no mandatory signaling or mandatory activation?  MTP abuse generally assumes miner adversity (usually at least enough miners to execute a selfish mining attack, e.g. ~30%) but a mere 15% of miners opposed to Speedy Trial should be able to prevent its activation by following the allowed protocol.\r\n\r\nHeights may be easier to reason about in some ways, but they don't directly provide the most important assurance we want in a Speedy Trial activation: that we will have a certain minimum amount of **time** to get many nodes upgraded to enforce taproot when it activates.  As far as I'm aware, miners screwing with time stamps---at a level less than that necessary to produce a time warp attack[1]---can only delay a deployment of this PR as written, and only at cost to the miners in the form of needing to do more PoW.  I think that's fine; we can be a little bit more patient.  But for a height-based activation, miners can accelerate the deployment either non-deliberately (e.g. because BTC price increases lead to increased mining) or deliberately (again at the cost of doing more PoW); I think that's an acceptable risk, but to my mind it's not as good as the assurance MTP can bring us.\r\n\r\nAgain, if there's an MTP edge case that applies to this PR that I'm not aware of, I'd certainly be interested in learning about it.  Overall, I feel this latest update improves this PR to where I slightly prefer it over height-based activation (although I'm still fine with either approach).\r\n\r\n[1] Time warp attacks break important properties of both MTP-based and height-based activation mechanisms; it also breaks important fundamental properties of Bitcoin.  Given that, I don't think we need to consider it here: I think miners know that trying a time warp attack on mainnet could easily lead to a PoW algorithm change.",

    "body": "@flack \r\n\r\n> wouldn't that mean that you can never bury a deployment again because there could be some signet where it hasn't activated yet?\r\n\r\nThe only plausible way I've come up with for burying deployments on signet is via MTP -- ie, declare that a soft-fork is unconditionally active on signet once the MTP passes some point, probably the MTP at which it activated on mainnet plus some delay; perhaps something like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconstexpr uint32_t ACTIVATION_MTP_THRESHOLD = 500000000;\r\nbool DeploymentActiveAt(block, params, dep) {\r\n    int h = params.DeploymentHeight(dep);\r\n    return (h < ACTIVATION_MTP_THRESHOLD ? block.nHeight >= h : block.GetMedianTimePast() >= h);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor custom signets that have chosen to activate the soft fork already, that's fine, because it's a soft fork the old blocks will still be valid even if they use rules that won't be enforced on a `-reindex` or by a new node doing IBD, and because blocks are signed, there is no risk of a reorg stealing funds. For custom signets that have not already activated the soft fork, it's fine as long as either miners upgrade to the new software before the signet flag day activation, or as long as the soft fork is safe and miners are not doing something like `-acceptnonstdtxn` so they won't mine blocks that are invalid under the new rules.\r\n\r\n@achow101 \r\n\r\n> It would make more sense to refactor the parameter setting and allow for the custom signets to set their own activation parameters, regardless of height or MTP.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's feasible from a usability standpoint: to use a custom signet you would have to define all the consensus parameters for all post-taproot forks, and do so in a way that's exactly compatible with all the other users of that custom signet.\r\n\r\nUsing MTP-based signalling allows a signet to be upgraded to a new soft fork simply by the signet miners signalling, with no action required by users at all beyond running an updated binary, which I don't think is achievable otherwise. (At minimum you'd need to update your config to set a \"activate this deployment early\" flag for each deployment on each custom signet)\r\n\r\n> Not necessarily. A deployment can be buried in one chain and not in another. With #19438, I think it would also be trivial to have a deployment buried in one chain and not in another.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of that is not true -- #19438 differentiates buried and signalled deployments by data type, which is constant for all chains at compile time.\r\n\r\nBut the point of burying deployments is so that we don't need to keep dealing with conditional activation -- eg, we don't need to support the possibility that segwit is activated but p2sh is not. We don't want to force ourselves to maintain those code paths to support random custom signets.",

If you have bursts like that to maintain difficulty anyway, you can just use them to get signalling done in a normal timeframe.\r\n\r\nBut ignoring that, I think an easy fix would be to lower signet's `nMinerConfirmationWindow` from 2016 to 288; that way normal signets can activate changes in four days instead of four weeks; and even a 1-hour-per-block signet that wasn't willing to do bursts wouldn't need to to take much longer than a month either (<12 days to hit a 288-block boundary, ~12 days to signal, ~12 days to lock in, so <36 days total).",

The old miner script used to let you target a block rate, but that would have an impact on difficulty that might be annoying to manage, so the new one lets you target a difficulty (`--nbits`) and adjusts the block rate to match; when you hit your difficulty target, it'll just average out at ~10min per block.",

    "body": "If it is currently not possible to bury/flag-day activate/vb signal at different heights/times in signet, it seems that this should be made possible via command line options, not by preferring MTP over height based vb code (or the other way round).\r\n\r\nAlso, I fail to see how MTP solves an issue that height based can't. Let's assume the signet default params for deployment mention a start and end parameter for a soft-fork, but someone wants to start a signet with the softfork always active. This can only be fixed by supplying modified source/binaries or by allowing the users/miners to pick the vbparams at runtime. It can't be fixed by using MTP over height (or the other way round).",

Other than that it's a wash, or it seems to be a net negative for clarity and testing. \r\n\r\nIf signets require a little more config data to be passed around, so be it. We should not be tying mainnet safety to configs of these networks. Based on my years of experience any proper operation of a \"non-official\" signet-like chain will be carting around a config file anyways.\r\n\r\nfwiw I'm deferring proper review of a PR until I think we can approach consensus on this topic.

    "body": "@MarcoFalke\r\n\r\n> Also, I fail to see how MTP solves an issue that height based can't. Let's assume the signet default params for deployment mention a start and end parameter for a soft-fork, but someone wants to start a signet with the softfork always active. This can only be fixed by supplying modified source/binaries or by allowing the users/miners to pick the vbparams at runtime. It can't be fixed by using MTP over height (or the other way round).\r\n\r\nThe issue for signet that MTP signalling solves that height based signalling doesn't is allowing multiple signets to operate with the same fixed-at-compile-time parameters. That avoids having to have every user of every signet add custom command line parameters that will change over the lifetime of the signet (as additional soft forks are deployed/activated).\r\n\r\nWith MTP signalling, if you want a non-buried soft fork \"always active\" on a new signet, you create the signet and mine 3 periods worth of blocks, signalling in the second period -- no need for anyone to set vbparams. (For a soft fork that's buried via MTP, you simply need to get MTP past the burial MTP, so likely only need to mine two or three blocks if you're creating a new signet for an already buried fork)\r\n\r\nIf you're adding height-based params to signetchallenge, you're making the challenge incompatible with existing nodes (that obviously don't support parsing and removing the vbparams from the challenge), but you're also requiring the challenge to change with each new soft fork: you'll need to add 'anyprevout=height' one day, then 'ctv=height' some other day, then 'consensuscleanup=height' some other day, and can't remove any of them, even after they're buried on mainnet. And you're also providing an extra way for people to make consensus-breaking mistakes, in hard to detect ways -- currently if you get the signet challenge wrong you'll just end up having a different network magic and not connect to the signet at all, but with optional parameters added you can't do the same, since you want to be backwards compatible by allowing the optional values to be missing.\r\n\r\n@Rspigler \r\n\r\n> I don't think signet should be a consideration for MTP vs height, since taproot is already activated on signet, and there's no indication that ST will be used in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we're not trying to use this as a stepping stone for future activations, then it would make sense to keep the changes for ST as simple as possible, and sticking with MTP is the smaller and more easily backportable set of changes...\r\n\r\nEven restricting the analysis purely to the effect on mainnet, and ignoring testing, implementation or backporting complexity, [I think MTP is superior](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018728.html); if it were blocking the ability to reasonably do a UASF then that would still be a showstopper, but as per the [LAST_CHANCE](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-808843817) comments above, I don't see any reason why that would be the case.",

As noted on [the mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018740.html), `min_lock_in_time` adds an additional 14 day uncertainty to the true activation time, whereas predicting the time for `min_activation_height` to be reached only gets better as that height approaches. A good enough prediction of the actual activation time can be known several days or weeks ahead. With `min_lock_in_time`, miners could also manipulate timestamps to introduce uncertainty in the activation time.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think that block heights is technically superior, many of the specific things that it guarantees are still provided by an MTP implementation probabilistically and some changes can be made to provide the same guarantees.

    "body": "From @maaku on [using block height versus a mix of block height and MTP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21393#issuecomment-815698514). Understandably he doesn't want to be involved. \r\n\r\n\"Segwit activation exposed a number of problems with the BIP9 activation state machine which was based on MTP windows. These concerns include:\r\n\r\nDifficulty of interfacing with in-parallel activation mechanisms like BIP148, BIP91, or the presumed future LOT=true UASF for taproot. (You may not like UASF. You may be against UASF and wish is never happened. Well reality doesn't care. There will be a UASF client, that is simply a fact. That cat is out of the bag. Our job is to make sure that UASF risks are minimized for the sake of the network, which height-based activation mechanisms do better. I'm not saying MTP can't be UASF compatible, I'm just saying it's way easier to avoid foot-gunning a UASF deployment with height-based windows. And while your inner schadenfreude might laugh at a UASF foot-gun, such a chain-splitting failure affects everyone.)\r\n\r\nPerverse timestamp-manipulation incentives for miners, who can use timestamp manipulation to slow or speed up MTP to delay or speed up the closing of an activation window. People rely on accurate MTP timestamps for things like lock times, and of course it affects difficulty adjustments, and so it is very bad for there to be incentives for miners to manipulate timestamps.\r\n\r\nTwo-week uncertainty over activation window start or end times based on alignment of 2016-block window with calendar dates. Makes it very difficult for people to schedule travel or events around a single likely activation date (+/- a day or two). This affects not just activation parties (which is a silly reason IMHO, even more so in the midst of a pandemic), but also mining and infrastructure organizations which will want staff at hand in case there are activation issues.\r\n\r\nBIP8 was specifically created to codify our lessons learned from activating segwit into a new activation protocol to be used in the next soft-fork. It got significant review 4 years ago and in the time since, and was strengthened by that review. There is no way that some new state machine for MTP-based activation could receive the same amount of review in the speedy trial timeline. We should use the reviewed mechanisms that are already in place (or very nearly so) and which incorporate lessons learned. If you think there are flaws in BIP8(LOT=false), then start working now on an alternative activation mechanism for the next soft-fork.\r\n\r\nEvery single one of the above points has been made on the mailing list or in relevant Github discussions. I don't think that any of them have been adequately addressed by MTP advocates. For example, pointing out that \"timewarp could cause more uncertainty than +/- 2 weeks\" ignores a few facts: (1) timewarp is NOT a normal condition and would itself be seen as an attack on the network; (2) timewarp would require the coordination of more miners than it would take to block taproot anyway; and (3) having monotonically decreasing estimation error without a two-week floor is critical to scheduling needs.\r\n\r\nI think many of us who were involved in that prior work that went into segwit lessons learned and BIP8 review are sitting around dumbfounded and speechless at what has happened. What is the point of doing all that advanced planning if it's immediately thrown away precisely when it is needed? I'm not surprised if Luke-Jr and Jorge seem obstinate on this. They've invested literally years on this problem so that we'd have a solution when it is needed, as it is now, and getting buy-in from the developers at the time... only to have all that casually thrown away. (Because of a freaking coin flip?)\"",

    "body": "I have few questions and issues:\r\n\r\n1. Is this strictly based on BIP 9 or modified version of BIP 9? If modified, what are the changes and reasons for it?\r\n\r\n2. What are the trade-offs involved in using ST|BIP9|MTP vs ST|BIP8|Block Height?\r\n\r\n3. Use of BIP 9:\r\n\r\nQuoting few things from https://medium.com/@elombrozo/forks-signaling-and-activation-d60b6abda49a since I had followed all the things in 2017 and Eric Lombrozo had been a part of lot of discussions I read or watched in different podcasts.\r\n\r\n_In hindsight, it\u2019s become clear that miner activation of soft forks cannot be relied upon when there exists a divergence of interests between miners and users. In the cooperative case, it is a tried and tested mechanism which if done correctly is known to work smoothly. However, in the **adversarial case** it simply does not work. BIP9 effectively gives a small amount of hashpower veto power over any soft fork activation no matter how widely popular it is among users and industry._\r\n\r\n_So given these lessons of the past, it seems that a **combination of MASF and UASF** will be required for future deployments to properly address these **adversarial scenarios**. It is **unlikely BIP9 will be ever used again**._\r\n\r\nQuoting few things from https://medium.com/hackernoon/peter-todd-on-the-essence-of-bitcoin-b8d0c6d16f43\r\n\r\n_No, definitely not. No. Most programmers in general, do you not have the capability to work on this stuff, because they don\u2019t think it **adversarially**. It\u2019s a tough thing for people to imagine. Most people are just not used to imagining, \u201cAll right, **what are the bad things that could happen**?\u201d_\r\n\r\nLot of people think its okay to ignore few things in this activation because we all want taproot and some think being prepared is PTSD from 2017. I don't agree with it because its Bitcoin and we need to be prepared for every bad scenario. We don't trust anyone if using full nodes for Bitcoin, why should we trust the miners who got incentives to mine blocks and in some case incentives to attack the network? \r\n\r\nI had mentioned few things in this email: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018613.html\r\n\r\nThere was one line written on the wall of a school I still remember: **The more we sweat in peace, the less we bleed in war**\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Use of MTP:\r\n\r\nAlthough SE answer and few other posts mentioned few trade-offs, I am still not sure if using MTP has no risk in a soft fork activation mechanism. Coinflip even if not considered for deciding MTP vs block height was wrong way to decide something involved in soft fork activation mechanism which can change lot of risk/rewards for miners to attack.\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/103854/should-block-height-or-mtp-or-a-mixture-of-both-be-used-in-a-soft-fork-activatio\r\n\r\n5. There are several occasions when something was preferred because it will take less time to review or less time to code and make changes. I understand its a \"Speedy\" Trial and things need to be done in less time with less people who go the right skills and experience, however this approach for development in Bitcoin Core (90% nodes use Bitcoin Core implementation) will not be good in long term. Maybe we need more people who can help and more people who can donate for such efforts. I appreciate everything done by @ajtowns and @achow101, also everyone who reviewed the PR but things can be improved. Bitcoin Core is [4th most critical C++ OSS project](https://twitter.com/_jonasschnelli_/status/1337351770192961540) and most of the users prefer using it when comparing usage of different implementations. \r\n\r\nhttp://gnusha.org/taproot-activation/\r\n\r\n6. Its not just @luke-jr who has different opinion about the approach and even if he is alone with a different idea that may work better, we should always respect his opinion as well. I have seen lot of comments in IRC logs which doesn't look good.",

    "body": "@prayank23 The activation mechanism is not the same as BIP9.   The spec is at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1104  because this is \"speedy trial\" and not BIP9 it has shorter duration, a lower threshold, and a minimum activation point (to give people adequate time to update).\r\n\r\nIn terms of preparation-- it is not feasible to prepare when you don't know what you're preparing for and the preparations come at great cost.  The idea with speedy trial is that is an inexpensive way to learn the lay of the land such that further moves (if required at all) can be informed by actual objective information,  rather than just having community members set their subjective speculations, hopes, and fears in a battle of rhetoric against each other.  Preparing for the wrong thing can easily be worse than not preparing at all.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you may misunderstand what the \"speedy\" part refers to here-- it isn't about implementation complexity.  It's about learning how activation might activate or fail, in detail, with objective facts quickly.  The implementation here is also designed to leverage the existing stored testing and experience because that is just prudent engineering and no amount of additional time or added developers can fully replace that. Even with all the resources in the world, you're better off not introducing changes without good cause-- those resources can better be used some other way. \r\n\r\nAs such the most valuable thing for ST to accomplish is to be over with soon (activated or expired) and to do so without continuing to burn up goodwill among community members fighting over opinions rather than facts.  If it activates, GREAT.  If it doesn't activate-- that's great too-- because we will have learned about how it didn't activate and that will inform the required preparations and tradeoffs for further efforts.  The veto comment is directly addressed by ST (and also really was partially a criticism not of BIP9 but of the fact that the NODE_WITNESS changes made segwit difficult to reissue, leading to a mistaken belief that if it didn't activate it couldn't be activated later.)\r\n\r\nST is in some sense the opposite of trusting.  Instead of \"trusting\" participants to behave in particular ways, we just set things up so that no matter what happens things will be okay and then we see what actually happens.  This is much better than speculating, which is really just trusting our guesses and trusting others to behave in particular ways (perhaps you trust them to behave badly, but that is still an expectation).  ST is all about minimizing subjective assumptions in favor of learning objective facts.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if anything, I'd characterize allowing a broadly supported improvement to get jammed over the fine details of activation is a perfect example of failing to think adversarially.   Even to someone who is of the view that the fine details of the activation here aren't the best possible under their preferred weighing of the tradeoffs should recognize that after ST is over (via activation or expiration) these activation criteria will not be relevant *at all* anymore.  This puts a strict upper bound on how much these details matter.\r\n\r\n> Coinflip even if not considered for deciding MTP vs block height\r\n\r\nSince it appears you know it wasn't actually used bringing it up here is not really appropriate. Please don't do that.  I'd like no more to discuss with you at length why I am confident you are mistaken, but it would be entirely off-topic here.\r\n",

    "body": "@prayank23 \r\n\r\n> 1. Is this strictly based on BIP 9 or modified version of BIP 9? If modified, what are the changes and reasons for it?\r\n\r\nIt's modified it two ways.  First, the timeout is only evaluated at the end of a STARTED period after all signaling blocks in that period have been counted.  This prevents miners from skipping over the signaling period altogether; that's mainly a concern for attempts to require mandatory signaling (e.g. a UASF) but it also simplifies things here a bit.\r\n\r\nSecond, it contains a minimum_activation_height parameter that delays activation of a locked_in fork until the specified height, making it compatible with the ST proposal.\r\n\r\n> 2. What are the trade-offs involved in using ST|BIP9|MTP vs ST|BIP8|Block Height?\r\n\r\nST|BIP9|MTP is compatible with activating future soft forks on signet.  ST|BIP9|Height is slightly simpler to review due to heights generally being monotonicly increasing and always being impossible to skip (although, again, this PR eliminates the skipping problem for MTP).\r\n\r\n>     3. Use of BIP 9:\r\n>\r\n> [Quoting from Eric Lombrozo] it\u2019s become clear that miner activation of soft forks cannot be relied upon when there exists a divergence of interests between miners and users.\r\n\r\nThat remains clear.  In the case of taproot, miners have said that there's a convergence of interests and Speedy *Trial* is an attempt to see if that's actually the case.  It's designed either quickly succeed or quickly fail so that we can, correspondingly, quickly move on to the next thing or get everyone in agreement that we need some sort of UASF.\r\n\r\n> it seems that a **combination of MASF and UASF** will be required for future deployments to properly address these **adversarial scenarios**. \r\n\r\nST is exactly that.  It's a MASF which, if it fails, is almost certain to lead to a UASF.  The insight here is that we don't need to bundle a MASF and a UASF together; we can do them independently to allow us to focus on one piece of the puzzle at a time.\r\n\r\n> It is **unlikely BIP9 will be ever used again**._\r\n\r\nIf you'd like, I believe I can do some digging to find other developers who disagreed with Lombrozo at the time he said that.  Moreover, it's also worth noting that what's proposed here is a modified version of BIP9---it has much the same relationship with BIP9 that BIP8 itself has with BIP9: an re-use of the same basic mechanism but tweaked for slightly different goals.\r\n\r\n>     1. Use of MTP:\r\n> Although SE answer and few other posts mentioned few trade-offs, I am still not sure if using MTP has no risk in a soft fork activation mechanism.\r\n\r\nNo change to consensus code is without risk.  MTP is slightly more complex to think about than height, but IMO not to the degree height should automatically outweigh any advantage of MTP.\r\n\r\n \r\n> I understand its a \"Speedy\" Trial and things need to be done in less time with less people who go the right skills and experience\r\n\r\nThis PR has so far been reviewed in depth by most of the experts I would expect to review any other activation mechanism.  I don't think we've short circuited the review process; indeed, perhaps because of the controversy, I think we've all been more careful here than we might've been had there been no controversy at all.\r\n\r\n>     1. Its not just @luke-jr who has different opinion about the approach\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, the technical objectors to this approach are:\r\n\r\n1. @luke-jr, on the basis that height is better than MTP and that he believes there's consensus to use BIP8.  IMO, the differences between height and MTP aren't significant enough to warrant a NACK and the previous widespread discussion about BIP8 doesn't represent consensus any more than widespread discussion of a block size increase in early 2015 represented consensus to hard fork.\r\n\r\n2. @maaku, on the basis that using MTP encourages miners to manipulate their block times and that BIP8/heights are easier and safer to use for non-devs creating their own UASFs.  IMO, significant time manipulation problems are extremely unlikely in the first place, super duper extremely unlikely for a ST, and are easier to mitigate than equivalent miner attempts to delay BIP8.  Also IMO, with a little bit of documentation, we can make it just as easy and safe for non-devs to create UASFs using this PR and MTP as for using BIP8.\r\n\r\n3. @michaelfolkson who I think has only echoed the arguments above.\r\n\r\nSeveral other people have expressed a preference for heights over MTP, but I personally don't think that's a reason to prevent merging this PR.  We will hopefully have many additional opportunities to activate feature-adding soft forks in the future, so we can iterate on the mechanism as we go---just as we've done from BIP30 flag day to BIP34 ISM to BIP9 to BIP148 to this PR.  It's better to do that work in parallel with waiting to see if miners use ST to lock in taproot than it is to delay taproot further while we argue over the subjective value of different people's preferences.\r\n\r\n(Note: I didn't see @gmaxwell's reply to your comment until I was previewing my draft of this comment; sorry if there's any redundancy.)",

Either we reach  LOCKED_IN state during the starttime/timeout range and delay activation until a _fixed point_ or we fail back to FAILED ? Fixed point can be time-based or height-based but in anycase this is not an _activation window_ with lower/upper bounds. \r\n\r\nTo clear this potential ambiguity, I think this variable should just be called `activation_height` and the delayed semantic be documented around ThresholdState::ACTIVE as its state transition condition isn't true anymore.\r\n\r\nFurther, consensus risks around this variable setting should be documented.\r\n\r\nLet's say you have client version=X reach locked_in at block height T, and activation height is scheduled for block height T+N. If a client version=Y is deployed with same activation logic but activation height M, with M < N, it will start to enforce taproot rules at height M.\r\n\r\nDo you have a risk of chain split between X and Y as this latter client version will consider invalid-taproot block between M and N as valid ?",

    "body": "> It's a minimum activation height, because activation could be later than that if min_activation_height is reached prior to timeout MTP being reached. With a fast enough increase in hashrate, you could probably reach any reasonable min_activation_height prior to timeout MTP being reached; and of course min_activation_height could be deliberately set in prior to or in the middle of the signalling period.\r\n\r\nRight, that said if you want to achieve ST goal's of backend delay, you should have a retarget period buffer between expected height of timeout and min_activation_height to swallow even a doubling of hashrate, or any other kind of scaling factor we deem *physically* unlikely to happen. Though this conversation belongs more to activation parameters selection. I agree, this logic could serve beyond ST-style of deployment.\r\n\r\n> minimum activation height is a fixed value, not a delta; so for your example, if client version X specifies min_activation_height H1 and version Y specifies min_activation_height H2 with H2<H1 then you'd expect Y to be enforcing different rules between H2..H1, because that's what you've told it to do. The only time they'd agree on the rules is if lockin occurs at a height >= H1-2016.\r\n\r\nI'm just concerned about successfully LOCKED_IN then having uasf folks bothered by the backend delay and willingly to fasten activation by tweaking `min_activation_height`. I'm not sure the immutable semantic of `min_activation_height` is that much understood. Though there is a thousand ways to fork yourself of the network if you have the intent, we can't prevent all of them to happen...\r\n\r\n>  Any change to deployment parameters can cause a change to what a client considers to be a valid block, and cause a consensus split; this isn't any different to changing the bit, starttime, timeout, period or     threshold...\r\n\r\nYes, but I think \"Once activation parameters have been released for a consensus change, they MUST NOT be changed to avoid risks of consensus split until reaching a final deployment state\" on top `BIP9Deployment` is good practice. Future code reviewers might not be as much familiar than us w.r.t to those consensus subtleties.",

Despite being the negation, is a lot harder to understand when the transition was happening because it was in states with multiple possible transitions, and the clause was guarding a state transition that becomes *impossible* rather than one that becomes *possible*. As such, even if this code contained an off-by-one error in the logic, it would only result in one additional period of LOCKED_IN as opposed to a failure to activate.\r\n\r\nThat said, there's no off-by-one error here AFAICT :)",

Backing it up after lock in would be unfair to smaller miners (< 10% total hash) who need more time to upgrade, so it would run counter to norms...\r\n2) In the future: it would be possible to do a Long-Range-Activation, e.g. a ST but with min_active_height far in the future (e.g., 2 years). Once it is locked in, then developers can start working on broader ecosystem support & wallet software integration knowing when it will be available. Once that seems ready, it is a soft-fork to decrease the min_height in a future release (but it still should be signalled for, but even if it isn't decreasing it is just a flag day soft fork, not hard fork AFAIU). I think that sounds like too much unnecessary fuss, but I _could_ imagine it being used.",

I guess previously there was no test for this because BIP 9 allowed (though discouraged) this. With the changes here this should be disallowed because the transition to FAILED (on timeout) no longer takes precedence over STARTED/LOCKED_IN. So with the changes here all softforks on the same bit might overlap, even when non-overlapping start-end times are picked.",

Not an issue for chains that are already well past genesis though, so real is limited to regtest, brand new signets, or someone trying to reorg mainnet/testnet3 all the way to genesis.",
