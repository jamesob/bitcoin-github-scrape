    "body": "Havent tested, but I agree with @laanwj. You check 4 conditions (mapwallet output.n !ispent ismine), coin control calls AvailableCoins, checking the same but even more conditions.\nSo it should never be possible to lock an unlockable coin in the GUI.\n\nI also suggest:\n- The condition when unlocking a coin could simply be, if it is already locked or not. It should always be possible to unlock a coin, if the coin appears in listlockunspent.\n- rename your function IsLockableCoin to IsAvailableCoin.\n  This way the function can also be used in the future for other stuff.\n- make this function IsAvailableCoin very similar to wallet->AvailableCoins, so that it is easy to maintain (I mean the conditions if(!FinalTx...) etc.)\n- put the function below AvailableCoins\n\nThis would be consistent with the GUI, checking the same conditions.\n",

    "body": "@laanwj yeah, that's fair. It bothered me slightly too, although, it seemed to be a bit of an existing convention to call a CWalletTx a \"coin\" or \"pcoin\". Do you think it would be less confusing to simply change the variable to \"wtx\"? Can you think of a better way to describe a transaction in this state, as opposed to \"available\"? Or would you just prefer that I remove the method altogether?\n\n@cozz I do like the property that IsAvailableCoin and AvailableCoins now share the same exact code. It seems like a stronger guarantee that the GUI and listunspent stay consistent with lockunspent.\n",
