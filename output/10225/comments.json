My change is minimal and works, so maybe it's an okay for now until #10082 is ready? (I'll gladly review btw.

I don't like NACKing PRs, but I really want to try to not put any additional complexity in util.py if we can help it.\r\n\r\nHave you had a look at getblocktemplate_longpoll.py ? That's doing something similar to this test where an additional asynchronous RPC thread is required. I've tried to rewrite your testcase in the same style here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/pr10225. Can you take a look and tell me what you think? I'd prefer to do it this way than adding more complexity to the mainline start_node() function. If we can get #10082 merged, then we can then look at adding an asynchronous RPC thread to the TestNode class so it's available more generally.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've found that this test fails intermittently when I run it locally. I think perhaps the `importprivkey()` is completing very quickly so it's a race condition and the `abortrescan()` call needs to arrive at the right moment.",

    "body": "@jnewbery Wow, the solution in getblocktemplate_longpoll.py was so much cleaner. I switched to that and dropped some commits. I also upped the range to hopefully address the intermittent fails you experienced. Edit: beginning to suspect problem is in fact in the abortres aborting too early. Added small sleep ([7''\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/f2d65693c6d291267a2e9eb78025de58343de7ee)).\r\n\r\n[Unsquashed history](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commits/abort-rescan-tests-unsquashed): [~~1~~](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/4dc2c402392cb516c32a7c06720a657a02a755a8) \u2192 [2](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/28c2abf9ea8f86479dab9c7c76a380cf303b26cb) \u2192 [~~3\u22b11~~](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/04e8620b9f4586ee91688d5617588c0f7728ab05) \u2192 [4\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/c2321ae106ef4d38774f8764ef200a26a6d28a2c) \u2192 [5\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/cf85ccf3769d699cece9cc37a0bec2d2a492eb90) \u2192 [6\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/2e9f0778dafa8af33f326dc1527d3a2ddd92651f) \u2192 [7''\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/f2d65693c6d291267a2e9eb78025de58343de7ee)\r\n",

    "body": "@jnewbery Is there an easy way to run the test like that? E.g. 20 times 4 in parallel?\r\n\r\nEdit: tests keep succeeding for me on a MacBook Pro. Running them on a linux machine (lubuntu) resulted in sporadic failures. Looking into it now.\r\n\r\nEdit: there are two cases where the test will fail; one is when the abortres loop sleeps right over the importprivkey time-to-finish (for `0.01`), and one, I realized, is when the importprivkey doesn't actually start up before the abortres loop ends. I increased the range from 200 to 2000, with sleep kept at `0.001`, which means a total approximate time of 2 seconds in the loop. This almost fixed it on my end but test started failing on the next assertion (aborted, so should not have balance). I bumped block chain size and that seems to have done it. This all feels very flakey though. :(\r\n\r\n[[...]](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commits/abort-rescan-tests-unsquashed): \u2192 [8\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/18de5191a95a47ae80f66fbb227df81c053d4088) \u2192 [9\u22b12](https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/commit/aadaf065a820bccac9b11df0ed3ca1315916b876)\r\n",

The dummy portseed parameter is overridden by an actual portseed further down in test_runner.\r\n\r\n> This all feels very flakey though. :(\r\n\r\nIndeed! Is it true to say there's a tradeoff between making the test case last longer and making it more robust? If that's the case I think you should err towards making it run longer and perhaps add it as an extended script rather than a base script.",

    "body": "@kallewoof - this has been backed out by #10327 . Please open a new PR so this test can be reviewed before being merged back in. A few suggestions for making this less flakey:\r\n\r\n- increase the number of generated blocks by at least an order of magnitude. Run the test many times on a fast machine, with bitcoind's datadir in /dev/shm. I think this passes on Travis because bitcoind runs slowly so you have a larger window for the `abortrescan` RPC to hit.\r\n- check the debug logs to see how long the rescan actually takes so we're not guessing on what a safe window is.\r\n- I think this test should be in the extended_test list rather than the base_tests list.\r\n- alternatively, tack this test onto a longer test script which already has a long chain, for example pruning.py. Seems a bit untidy, but should guarantee that the rescan takes a long time.",
