The dependency build will obviously produce a file per architecture, but can we use an architecture-specific input?\n\nEdit: I guess I can just put both architecture dependencies files as inputs, and then select the one to use based on the current arch (uname -m).\n\nEdit.2: could someone have told me about GBUILD_BITS?!? :p\n",

Also there is no end to that rabbit hole: if you statically link Qt, you create a direct dependency on a ton of X11 libraries.\n- Relying on dynamic OpenSSL: can be both an advantage and  disadvantage (depending on how up to date the distribution is keeping them)\n- Relying on dynamic Boost: BAD. This means we need a specific boost package installed, also boost 1.46 is old and it's all that can be relied on to be present on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nI'm going to roll a boost-linux.yml dependency package with static boost, so that Linux is able to use boost 1.55 as well.
