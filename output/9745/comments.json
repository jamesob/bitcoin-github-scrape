    "body": "Hey! Just wanted to say nice work for your first PR @34ro :) In terms of code quality and formatting I think you've done a nice job & your implementation seems correct and pragmatic. Great to see that you even added tests!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I agree somewhat with @jonasschnelli with regards to the necessity of this work. I don't think that the RPC bandwidth will be so large as to cause a problem in this specific case (most transactions don't have an insane amount of vins and vouts), but I do agree in general that this is worthwhile to think about (especially if you ever wanted to connect a mobile phone or something :) ) \r\n\r\nHowever, I do have one possible way of fixing your problem (excessive bandwidth) without needing to add a whole new RPC. You could change the order of the entries in the JSON such that the non variable-length fields are first, followed by the variable length fields. This way, your low-bandwidth client can read out just the first packet, parse far enough to read the confirmations field, and then ungracefully terminate the TCP connection. That's kind of a \"dirty ugly hack\" so it's only half-serious.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution to this would be somewhat like long polling -- keep the http connection open after the RPC, and also allow a parameter fWatch to be sent. On every call to connectblock, another JSON could be sent over with just the delta (e.g., {\"confirmations\" : 1 } then {\"confirmations\": 2}). This is somewhat similar to what @jonasschnelli suggested but has the benefit of not closing the tcp socket until you're actually done with it. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Just wanted to add that while a better notification method would be nice, *practically* this is already possible with `-blocknotify`. The number of confirmations of a transaction can only change when a block comes in. The thing I'm not sure about is whether race conditions - it may be possible that the wallet has not processed the block yet when your script launches. A `-walletblocknotify` that is called when the wallet processed a new block could avoid that problem.",
