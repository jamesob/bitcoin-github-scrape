    "body": "In general I am sympathetic to the idea of trying to offer up policies that people want as much as reasonably possible, but my initial reaction is that this change isn't a good idea.  I don't think we should offer policies that don't make sense for a user to logically choose.\n\nWhat would be the motivation for someone turning off opt-in RBF in favor of a no-replacement policy?  If it's because they don't want to personally accept transactions that might be later replaced, then I think we should just make sure that bitcoind offers whatever tools a user would need to determine whether a transaction is opting-in, so the user can reject the payment if they choose.  Not accepting opt-in transactions at all seems much more useful to the user than locally choosing to not accept replacements of such transactions.  Breaking relay of opt-in RBF replacement transactions seems to offer no additional local benefits that I can see (at least, not any local benefits that can't be better achieved a different way), while it would provide some harm to part of the network (namely those users who might use it in the future).\n\nSo offering it as a policy might be confusing to people, since having the option implies there's a good reason some might want to turn it off, and I don't think there is such a reason.  (If there is currently a reason, say because bitcoind doesn't currently make it easy for users to know whether a transaction is opting-in, then I think we should make that easy instead, which is not difficult to implement.  If there are other reasons, I'd like to hear them.)\n\nI can understand the motivation for offering full-RBF, as it makes sense to me that some users might want that policy, but given the existence of opt-in RBF, is full-RBF likely to offer meaningfully different outcomes for what gets into your mempool?  I expect not, and I don't see the need for Bitcoin Core to support what has been a controversial policy that we expect would provide minimal actual benefit to users choosing to run it.\n",

I would expect many users to be confused if they were to use that setting and then see transactions in their mempool get double-spent, because the rest of the network has a (known and documented!) different policy.  That strikes me as a dangerous configuration and likely to cause any non-expert user significant confusion.\n",

To @sdaftuar's point, they may want to be able to make txs non-replaceable, but that doesn't occur just by them changing their local policy.  I can't believe I'm suggesting this, but perhaps a more useful feature would be the ability to flag a single tx as non-replaceable, which might be something miners wanted to do if they want to mine a particular version of a spend.  Would require some changes to the RBF logic though..\n",

    "body": "@petertodd understood that it's opt-in by default. My point is that even a small % of mining power running full-RBF will be effectively kill zero-conf for existing users. There is a separate debate as to whether people should be relying on zero-conf (they shouldn't), but if we are going to allow/encourage even a small percentage of miners to enable full-RBF then there is really no point adding the opt-in semantics to transactions, because zero-conf will be broken anyway for a significant % of blocks. Obviously miners today could still compile and run your full-RBF patch themselves, but that is significantly more work than simply enabling a flag in core.\n\nTo be clear, I am totally fine with the feature \"Make RBF policies optional\", but I think it would be dangerous to add a feature \"Allow nodes to opt in to full-RBF\" today. If the `nRbfPolicy = 1` option is removed (allowing only no-RBF or opt-in-RBF) then I have no issue with this PR.\n",

Most pools don't mind being tracked as is since it's basically free advertising.\n\nIMO any spam filtering should be completely agnostic in regards to the specific sender and receiver otherwise the bitcoin would lose fungibility.\n",

Hopefully more people realize this.\n\nI do not see any miner today running full-RBF-always (for good reason). There clearly is no sound reason for implementing such an option. Also, I don't really see a use-case for disabling the opt-in behavior altogether. In fact, this patch only contributes to making 0-conf behavior completely unreliable. I believe this PR is an attempt at undermining current 0-conf behavior to create a reality where full-RBF-always behavior can easily get merged.\n",

My understanding is that full-RBF is a controversial change and that many developers have argued against it, hence the compromise to support opt-in RBF transactions.\n\nCurrently no pools are running full-RBF that I am aware of, despite @petertodd's lobbying for this. Most miners have no interest in breaking existing use-cases for bitcoin or supporting merchant fraud. It is true that a single large mining pool could probably break zero-conf for everyone, but currently none have, and many bitcoin users/merchants would like to maintain the status quo (at least until more secure zero-conf alternatives have matured). What I am afraid of is that making this a built-in flag in bitcoin would make it easier to lobby unsuspecting miners into running full-RBF (\"hey, just enable this flag to earn more money\"), which is significantly more difficult than \"hey, just recompile bitcoin with my custom patch\".\n\nIs there any reason not to simply remove the full-RBF option from this PR, and stick to the stated intent (making opt-in RBF optional)?\n",

For example, if pulling off a double spend attack is fairly difficult and expensive to do with FSS-behavior across the network, then that means it is very unlikely that attack actually happens a lot (for small payments).

If there would be no limit, an attacker would be very unlikely to make a really big, over sized block because the orphan risk for himself would be too great. Additionally, the reputation loss would be critical and could lead to an exclusion of the miner from the rest of the network. In reality this attack will probably never happen. \n\nIn conclusion, it does not make sense to design the system in favor of complete adversarial conditions. In both the case of full-RBF and also block size limits, Bitcoin Core is actually threatened to become a dangerous client to run considering the overall health of the Bitcoin network (0-conf reliability and congestion effects). And this is all due to the fact that there is too much fear of adversarial conditions and not enough trust in game theory.\n",

The upstream project, us, has some trust.\n\nSince you also proposed a [straight change to the default](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7119/files#diff-12635a58447c65585f51d32b7e04075bR54) earlier that @btcdrak questioned and @gmaxwell closed, your position is clearly pro-RBF, and not pro-opt-in-RBF.  \n",

    "body": "@petertodd note for the record I am no longer affiliated with Coinbase, so information may be a little out of date and opinions here are my own.\n\nThe biggest target for 0-conf scammers are gift cards (both dedicated gift retailers, and regular merchants who sell gift cards). These are usually delivered electronically and easily be cashed out via purse.io or similar with little to no verified KYC. Generally the bitcoin payment processor eats the fraud cost once a transaction is marked as accepted via their API, so even though the retailer could simply cancel the gift card (if they were fast enough), they have no incentive to, and these systems are usually not automated anyway.\n\nRequiring confirmations is also not even possible for some merchants (for example: legacy e-commerce systems which cannot place a hold on inventory longer than 15 or 30 minutes, when a single bitcoin confirmation can sometimes take upwards of 1 hour). So these merchants would probably opt to stop receiving bitcoin payments altogether rather than wait for confirmations. Arguably this is not a huge loss for the bitcoin ecosystem, since very few people are using bitcoin to make online purchases where credit cards are already accepted, but it would be disappointing to see nonetheless.\n\nGenerally I believe fraud costs are currently at an acceptable level (because merchants are still accepting 0-conf). However, if the _% of mining power running full-RBF_ ever increases above _% discount which gift cards can be flipped online_, it would significantly alter the economics here.\n",

And since is also trivial to maintain, the same arguments apply, even if I personally think that is probably the stupidest spend conflict replacement policy after -policy=lastseen (yes, I think -policy=randomreplace makes a lot more sense).\n",

    "body": "There's never a strict need for a continue statement:\n\n```\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (!fA)\n       continue;\n    // Do AAA\n}\n```\n\nIs equivalent to\n\n```\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (fA) {\n      // Do AAA\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwhich is what we had and you are changing for no good reason.\nThe second version (what we currently have) is not only more readable but also more flexible, for example, say we want to change the code to do the following:\n\n```\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (fA) {\n      // Do AAA\n    }\n   // Do BBB\n}\n```\n\nIn the second example it's just adding the new code out of the if statement, in the first case we have to rewrite the code like the first case and indent first.\nThe only reason I can think of for using continue is reducing this PR's total diff(by avoiding the indent to the code under the new condition, or creating a new sub-function for the code under the new condition), but it doesn't make the diff (or the final resulting code) more readable, so I really don't see the point.\nI would generally avoid using continue unless it's one of those rare cases where its use actually increases readability and reduces the potential for bug introduction (instead of the opposite as it usually does). \nFor example, many continue statements in the same loop may be more readable than excessive nesting:\n\n```\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (!fA)\n       continue;\n    // Do AAA\n    if (!fB)\n       continue;\n    // Do BBB\n    if (!fC)\n       continue;\n    // Do CCC\n    if (!fD)\n       continue;\n    // Do DDD\n    // E, F, G...\n    // Do ZZZ\n}\n```\n\nis more readable than, but equivalent to\n\n```\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (fA) {\n      // Do AAA\n      if (fB) {\n         // Do BBB\n         if (fC) {\n           // Do CCC\n           if (fD) {\n              // Do DDD\n                // E, F, G...\n           } // D\n         } // C\n      } // B\n    } // A\n    // Do ZZZ\n}\n```\n\nOf course, the readability disadvantages of excessive nesting can always be fixed with sub-functions instead:\n\n```\nbool DoFromA()\n{\n   if(fA) {\n       // Do AAA\n       return DoFromB();\n   }\n   return false\n}\nbool DoFromB()\n{\n   if(fB) {\n       // Do BBB\n       return DoFromC();\n   }\n   return false\n}\n// DoFromC(), etc\n\nwhile(fCondition)\n    if (DoFromA()) {\n      // Do ZZZ\n    }\n```\n",
