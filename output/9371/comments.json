    "body": "@laanwj ah, sorry I hadn't seen #8549.  The reason I did it this way instead of trying to do notifications from the mempool directly was because we had just gone to such much effort to remove other notifications from happening within cs_main during the block connection logic.  \r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to add to this PR the ability to distinguish between: \"added\", \"removed\", \"appeared in a disconnected block\", but slightly more involved to distinguish between the various \"removed\" reasons. (EDIT: I suppose the approach used in #8549 would work just as easily, we could just save the reason state in the vector.)\r\n\r\nWhichever approach we take, I think it's a step in the right direction towards cleaning up the notification design and we should keep going.  Note for example that even after #8549, I think \"rawtx\" and \"hashtx\" notifications are also happening on transactions in disconnected blocks (and before #9240 in transactions removed due to conflict), which doesn't seem to be the intent.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Yes @laanwj had a similar comment.\r\nWhat I wanted to accomplish was that the notifications (or at least some of the potentially time consuming ones) happened outside of the critical path.  The same as the change we recently made with transactions in connected blocks.  But perhaps there is a better way to design that where the mempool just fires off its notifications immediately, but there can be a helper class that subscribes and appropriately batches them before passing them on?  It's a bit tricky to imagine how some removals caused by limiting inside ATMP should be fired immediately and some shouldn't, but there ought to be a way.\r\n\r\nIn any case I'm open to a suggestion on redesigning that aspect of it.\r\n",

I wouldn't argue that we want to keep this class in the long run, but as a regression fix for 0.14, I think this most clearly accomplishes the goal while moving us in a forward direction.\r\n\r\nIn the future we will want to rethink exactly what notifications need to fire on mempool removals and when.  Most of the wallet functionality that is called by SyncTransaction is a no-op on mempool removals except for downstream notifications.   This is documented.\r\n",

Even if its rebased on #9570 (so that SyncTransaction becomes SyncTransactions and they're all batched together), the multiple per-block SyncTransactions calls will still expose wallet state as of mid-block to RPC clients. I'm not sure how exactly we should go about fixing this, but one way might be to take @theuni's suggestion for 0.14 and split SyncTransaction to SyncTransactionsFromBlock(vTxnConnected, vTxnConflicted) and TransactionAddedToMemPool(tx) so that we can hold the cs_wallet lock the whole time in SyncTransactionsFromBlock.\r\n\r\nOf course, as noted in #9240, the only visible state from the SyncTransaction calls from CONFLICTED transaction removals is to un-abandon some transactions and update the UI/call walletnotify, both of which I think maybe are OK.",

That behavior got broken again in 7e89994133725125dddbfa8d45484e3b9ed51c6e from #16624 and we are currently discussing how to restore it in #18325",
