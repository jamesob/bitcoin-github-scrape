    "body": "Addition of seed.bitnodes.io was discussed and ACK'ed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3875. This is part of getaddr.bitnodes.io infrastructure sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation and operated independently by myself. I believe most of the seeders are operated based on sipa's bitcoin seeder (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder). seed.bitnodes.io is based on a separate Python implementation available from https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes/blob/master/seeder.py. Nodes with most common height are selected on random basis and served via NSD authoritative-only DNS server. The seeder is currently hosted on a dedicated server by Hetzner in Germany and has been one of the most healthy according to http://bitcoinstats.com/network/dns-servers/. I'd be happy to provide more evidence if so required in order to continue the operation of the seeder.\n",

They need to be established within the community. ie before bitnodes and open-nodes they were run by developers who had been working on Bitcoin Core and had established trust that they were both technically competent and were acting for the good of Bitcoin. Though I dont propose that only developers can run a DNS seed, running a DNS seed is not something that someone who has no previous experience in the Bitcoin development community can do.\n",
