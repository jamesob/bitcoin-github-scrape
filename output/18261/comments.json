    "body": "@luke-jr  I'm understanding your question as being inspired by earlier 'mempool sync' ideas that would bleed bandwidth if there was a long lasting mempool discrepancy.\r\n\r\nErlay isn't a mempool sync. It's uses a way of communicating lists of things you want to relay which only takes bandwidth proportional to the difference rather than the total size.  So there is no on-going bandwidth usage due to differences in *mempool* content. Bandwidth is used is roughly  A*ntx_relayed + B*peers*(difference_in_tx_relayed) + C*peers.  for some constants A,B,C. \r\n\r\nIf a peer has a radically different relay policy than you, it works fine and continues to save bandwidth below what usage would be without erlay even though the erlay savings itself comes largely from eliminating data that both sides would send.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question?",

The running times of these are quite substantial - is there some way to do a quick sanity check as part of `make check` instead of exhaustive testing? :)\r\n",

    "body": "More experiments: now I ran the same 2 nodes for 24 hours, but connected to 16 instead of 8 nodes (yeah, all 16 peers of Erlay node support reconciliation).\r\n\r\nLegacy wtxid-relay node spent 150 megabytes for announcements, while Erlay node spent 24 megabytes. Since these 2 days might have had different activity, it makes sense to compare the growth.. Legacy grew 2.23x (I guess due to more INVs in total), Erlay grew 1.8x. So, as expected, not only it's decent savings comparing to legacy, it also grows slower with connectivity.\r\n\r\nBased on the following facts I also make a guess that there's no point in tweaking Erlay forward for better performance:\r\n- only 0.0016 reconciliation failed (fully or partially) \u2014\u00a0meaning we don't underestimate much\r\n- only 15% of the announcement bandwidth is sketches \u2014\u00a0meaning we don't overestimate much\r\n- only 15% of the announcement bandwidth is *outbound* invs (which are much more likely to still be a little wasteful, because those peers are better connected than us and likely don't need those announemens)\r\n\r\nFinally, I measured delay in receiving transactions. I take the earliest time I received a transaction, and take latency from there, comparing to:\r\n- an average receiving time at all legacy nodes: 0.92s \r\n- at the Erlay node: 1.47s\r\n\r\nI think this is expected and fine, as we talk in the paper, but let me know if you think differently.",

    "body": "Me and @sipa decided to switch to \"extension sketches\": instead of requesting a bisection, someone who failed to decode the difference from the initial sketch, may ask for an extension of the initial sketch.\r\nA responder then have to send syndromes of higher order only.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation is it seems like bisection adds a lot of complexity (see b5c92a41e4cc0599504cf838d20212f1a403e573).\r\nExtensions have all the same properties after all, but they're more CPU-costly. We think it's fine for sketches of small capacity (what we expect to have here) to ignore this disadvantage.\r\n\r\nSo, for now, please review up to a30e861c9cada8fbc400d07255516839480d9e9d (but also feel free to review further if you're curious).\r\n\r\nI will replace bisection with extensions and update the BIP soon.",

    "body": "Starting the review by digging into the BIP :)\r\n\r\nFew remarks :\r\n1) \"improves privacy as a side-effect\", it would be great to explain and document this claim, maybe add a section in Rationale ?\r\n2) \"truncated transaction IDs\",  AFAIU, Erlay introduces new shortened transaction identifiers for regular tx-relay, maybe it could be better to call them \"truncated WTXID\" ? If BIP 330 implies BIP 339, it could be better to remove references to transaction ID or at least when it's ambiguous\r\n3) You mentioned switching to extension sketch and mentioned the updated BIP was ready for review, I think you need to update the \"intented protocol flow\" schema, remove `reqbisec` and update Rationale ?\r\n4) You might swap the \"Local State\" section before messages, it could be easier to explain q-coefficient before using them in New messages\r\n",

    "body": "I think the approach needs rethinking for the reasons stated here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#pullrequestreview-570100861. The Erlay logic in this PR is spread across many functions in net_processing.cpp and reconcilliation.h, which means that it's impossible to test that logic in isolation. I suppose that's why there aren't any unit tests included in this PR.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much cleaner to have a fully separate module, similar to how txrequest was separated from the rest of net_processing. That module maintains its own private state and exposes a limited number of interface methods to net_processing. That means that it's possible to very thoroughly unit test and fuzz test that module in isolation.",

Here, it seems that we don't set up any reconciliation to occur with an inbound peer that doesn't want to reconcile with us, because we only send reconciliations to our outbound peers, and require that inbounds who want to reconcile be the requestor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a comment that reminds the reader that if we give up on setting up reconciliation with a peer, that we default to flooding to that peer?",

Since we reduce the poisson timer for peers we think we're reconciling with, this could be a way to game a quicker INV time to be a better spy node.\r\n  * this doesn't seem to actually work because they'd have to wait for 2 poisson timers to go off before getting the prior batch of announcements, which is approximately the same (other than integer division) as the same inv timer that inbound peers normally get. Though perhaps this would get them their own poisson timer, rather than having to use the bucket that all inbounds share?  That seems not great -- an adversary could use multiple inbound connections this way to effectively get a small poisson timer (on average).\r\n\r\n- Countervailing idea is that if the peer is just held up for some reason, the older transactions are more likely to reconcile successfully than the newest ones, so it's probably bandwidth minimizing in the honest case to hang on to the older ones in the reconciliation set.",

Should we add some sort of acknowledgement message so that both sides know whether reconciliation is enabled on the link?\r\n\r\nOur own logic seems to change based on whether we *think* we're reconciling with a peer; if some other implementation turns on both sending and responding (for instance) and then we silently ignore all their reconciliation requests, that seems suboptimal for everyone.  Likewise, if we think we've enabled reconciliation with a peer but it has a different policy, it would be better for our software to know that reconciliation isn't going to actually happen.",

If the other party announced recon protocol 2, things will just default to protocol 1 without problems (which means forcing any client that supports protocol 2 to also support protocol 1). If a change would be made that is so incompatible that we don't expect clients to support the old one anymore, a different negotiation message would be used, or 0 could be sent.\r\n\r\nIn commit \"Handle reconciliation support announcement\":\r\n\r\nThe code would be something like this to accomodate that:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/* must match announcement logic */\r\nstatic constexpr uint32_t RECON_VERSION = 1;\r\nbool us_sender = !IsInBound(), us_responder = IsInBound(); \r\n\r\nbool they_sender, they_responder;\r\nvRecv >> they_sender >> they_responder >> recon_version >> remote_salt;\r\nrecon_version = std::min(recon_version, RECON_VERSION);\r\nif (recon_version < 1) return;\r\nbool recon_sender = us_sender && they_responder, recon_responder = us_responder && they_sender;\r\n// If we ever announce us_sender && us_responder, this will need tie-breaking (picking the outbound side as sender)\r\nassert(!(recon_sender && recon_responder));\r\n```\r\n",

Non-reachable nodes may open connections to outbound not supporting reconciliations, thus relying on flooding for transaction announcements, at least until Erlay is well-deployed. \r\n\r\nI think the leak would be constituted by a differential tx-announcement protocol selection for re-broadcast tx rather than the usual one previously negotiated with the peer. Doesn't matter if it's flooding or reconciliation.\r\n\r\n`inbound->outbound` better to say \"flooding is initiated by inbound towards outbound peers\". Not sure that `->` to signify initiation is well-understood as a comment notation...",

    "body": "this salt calculation (and probably also the flood_to logic) seems like an example of code that can be extracted into the reconciliation module rather than added to `ProcessMessage`.\r\n\r\nit would make sense to me for the flow to be something like: \r\n- `ProcessMessage` does internal state checks (`m_tx_relay` exists, wtxid is enabled)\r\n- extract the message from `vRecv`\r\n- pass it along into the module to handle \r\n- module returns saying \"no-op\" or \"here is a ReconState object\" \r\n- if it exists, `ProcessMessage` stores the object on the peer\r\n\r\nI suspect we could go even further, but this would be a start. Ideally the module would abstract this nuanced erlay specific logic away from net processing, even if its per-peer. The txrequest module is a good example for this, eg. `PeerInfo` struct and how its applied within the module to make choices, and the decisions are surfaced to `net_processing`. ",

Even if reconciliation roles are decided in function of our peer selection, they should be clearly dissociated as orthogonal.\r\n\r\nACK, although I think \"inbound\" is not initiated, but it's accepted.",
