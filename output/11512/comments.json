The only issue I have with it is that we'll now only create a oneshot to a single resolve result if the subdomain isn't supported, meaning that it's pretty damn important to have subdomain support.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to this could be to add the notion of oneshot-only peers to addrman: If the source of an address is a special internal value (NET_INTERNAL), assume that it came from a dns seed without filtering. That way, any time addrman chooses that address, it's only usable for oneshots.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's necessary to go that far until filtering is sufficiently complicated, though.",

It feels silly to me to do a DNS resolve which we know won't resolve (or, if it happens to be a catch-all for subdomains, we'll even end up adding unfiltered results - possibly with incorrect service flags - to addrman). I'd rather either remove support for unfiltered seeds, or leave the boolean in and for those with a `false` flag immediately fallback to a oneshot connection.",
