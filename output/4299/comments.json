    "body": "@laanwj Yes the code is simpler than calling getaddrinfo_a(), but as I've mentioned in the PR message, it doesn't fully achieve our purpose because:\n1. There is a lacking of timed wait in asio model, so without refactoring the caller we cannot make it work in an really efficient way, but fall into the waiting loop and face the problem of choosing a suitable waiting interval;\n2. Inside the asio::async_resolve(), a new thread would be created to call getaddrinfo(), which is blocking, and the asio::io_service have to wait the thread exit before it could be destructed, which makes the LookupIntern() uninterruptable during this waiting period, while getaddrinfo_a() doesn't have this issue.\n\nAnd let's go back to the original situation, first I noticed that the dnsseed thread always prevented my bitcoind from quitting immediately, because it works in a loop to collect addresses for all dns seeds.  So I made the first change to add two interruption points inside the dnsseed thread, just around the places where a call placed would go down into LookupIntern().  It does help, by reducing the waiting time from about one quarter to tens of seconds or several minutes, because every call to LookupIntern() would block for seconds or minutes depends on network and requesting name.  However a several minute waiting is still not good enough so I go down to LookupIntern() and change it to use getaddrinfo_a() instead of getaddrinfo(), that change dramatically reduced the waiting to any short time interval you can specified, another benefit is that the getaddrinfo_a() provides a timed wait interface to let the caller get its expected result whenever it is available without having to wait for the fixed time interval.\n\nAs the second issue mentioned above, to the dns seed, choosing asio::async_resolve() inside LookupIntern() is the same as my first change of adding two interruption points around its call going to LookupIntern().\n\nBase on the above reason, I'd rather suggest to pick PR 4259, although this may looks simpler or more portable...\n\nMy two cents.\n",

    "body": "@laanwj Yes the asio internal event loop is naturally interruptible, the problem is that it really is only when the interruption is _natural_, e.g. a SIGTERM signal from the OS.  But in our cases, where the event loop resides, say dnsseed thread, generally speaking, would have no chance to receive such a signal, but rely on boost::thread::interrupt() call to notify it the interruption request, so we have to explicitly place one interruption point inside the event loop.\n\nA slightly better / or cleaner manner to avoid a explicit wait loop with ios.poll() in LookupIntern() is to place one interruption point inside the handler, while using ios.run() simply.  By this way, we actually leverage the internal event loop inside ios.run() itself.\n\nHowever, no matter which way we take, as the discussion below, we still have to wait for the current outstanding call to getaddrinfo() returns, that may take quite a long time depends on the network and requested dns name, e.g. on my test box, the \"dnsseed.bluematt.me\" would cost about 5 minutes before return nothing.\n",
