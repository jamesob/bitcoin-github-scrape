    "body": "Why? The comment above even says that it specifically does not set LC_ALL because it seg fauls (core cumps) when it is set. Means that if I have LC_ALL set and exported and run this script it will segfault. So to me it looks as if unsetting LC_ALL for good should be required on all platforms.\r\n\r\nI can see how this makes one uneasy (at least it makes me uneasy). According to one of the lints all scripts _should_ set LC_ALL=C and export it in order to make it not behave differently on different platforms. Unfortunately that makes shellcheck segfault/coredump. As I learned the hard way.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is a specific locale which does not make it segfault, but I would assume that that locale is exactly the default locale for the platform. And as long as none of the shell scripts use any fancy characters (basically ASCII only) it should not come to any behavior changes in between any modern platforms.",

    "body": "@scravy I wrote that comment in the code :-)  The comment says that `LC_ALL=C` segfaults under certain `shellcheck` versions (perhaps a certain Ubuntu distributed `shellcheck` binary?), so my suggestions is to make the workaround (`unset LC_ALL`) conditional on where we have found that it is actually needed. That way we document when it is needed which will help us make an informed decision on when to remove the workaround in the future, such as when that specific problematic `shellcheck` version/binary is no longer in active use. Makes sense?",
