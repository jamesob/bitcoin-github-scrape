    "body": "Have you tested the effect of random exploration vs largest first exploration? \r\n\r\n* Either way, BranchAndBound already guarantees that the global utxo set doesn't grow (for one output transactions) due to saving the change output.\r\n* LFE guarantees the creation of a minimal input set, and purposefully finds a possible solution. This should minimize the input set size variance. In my simulations BranchAndBound with LFE already caused a smaller average UTXO footprint than legacy Core selection.\r\n* Random Exploration could find a larger input set by skipping a key UTXO higher up in the tree. This could lead to the selection of a larger number of inputs, or in an edge case could even cause tries to be exhausted before a solution is found. This may increase input set variance, or could perhaps even exhaust small UTXOs too quickly for BnB to often find a viable solution.\r\n\r\nI am not sure there is a significant privacy benefit for Random Exploration as for either selection method an attacker would already need to know about another eligible input that would achieve an exact match when switched out for one of the input set.\r\n\r\nWhat benefit do you expect from using Random Exploration?",

    "body": "I found out that the [two](https://github.com/Xekyo/CoinSelectionSimulator) [repos](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/coinselect) for coinselect simulation returned different results for the same strategy, so I painstakingly went through both of them and found where they differ... and put tons of of PRs to both, so they now both return the same results with the same fees + setup\r\n\r\nThe differences in simulations were:\r\n* how they deal with insufficient funds (and how they detect it)\r\n* what is minimum change\r\n* what are the sizes of \"defaut\" input/output\r\n* some small bugs\r\n\r\n...and those added to significant differences. Anyway, when I fixed all the issues, those are the results/graphs I get:\r\n\r\nthis is for the moneypot scenario, with the fees 10 sat/bitcoin\r\n\r\n![chart 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104945/28293394-434c8272-6b54-11e7-86c9-1a1b9b36afee.png)\r\n[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ePfoi08uV_QU48Q68aAu6apB-BG9DwM52JRgxNgSWPk/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nthis is for the moneypot scenario, when I increase the fee to 200 sat/bitcoin (but I left the values, so more utxos become unspendable)\r\n\r\n![chart 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104945/28293860-a802573a-6b56-11e7-9ee5-7b3f6bbe18fd.png)\r\n[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtjK_RJ7Zj3LduJB9_q1gf8LnbGpgp4gA_Sy_1UYLUo/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nIn both, rand is slightly better. I am not sure what happened, if it's because the scenario is different (without the large UTXO set) or because of the subtle differences in benchmarking. The shape is similar though.\r\n\r\nThis is the scenario of small randomly generated wallets\r\n\r\n![chart 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104945/28293569-0b1c9ba2-6b55-11e7-9201-a9f3c4884b44.png)\r\n[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zUen5aiKfDwRIRkOg-QJgAE0uEn-_OsrSUQwJm2xWDs/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nBnB+LF performs better, optimum about 50% cost of change.\r\n\r\nSo, different strategies/parameters are better at different scenarios. Again, there is danger of overfitting on one scenario - plus there might be some more subtle bugs in the benchmark code... in my wallet code, I will probably just use BnB+LF with 50% of cost and call it a day :)\r\n\r\nI haven't shown this in graphs, but having BnB is always better than not having it. :)\r\n\r\nIf you want to repeat the tests, my forks of the repos are here [1](https://github.com/runn1ng/CoinSelectionSimulator/tree/final_run) [2](https://github.com/runn1ng/coinselect/tree/final_run)",

    "body": "Pieter pointed out that the algorithm doesn't necessarily find the best solution when it discovers the first solution. However, it was then at first not clear how to make the trade-off between making the input set smaller or reducing the excess in the selection.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that during high fee rates, it might be beneficial to the user if a smaller input count is preferred in exchange for a higher excess, while at low fee rates, a higher input count might be acceptable to achieve a smaller excess.\r\n\r\nWe came up with the waste metric to combine both of these dimensions:\r\n\r\n    waste = excess + #inputs * (feeRate - longterm feeRate)\r\n\r\nwhere `excess` is the amount that we overshoot the selection target, and the second term derives from how much more expensive it is to spend the inputs right now than we expect in the longterm.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm now doesn't stop on the first solution, but continues to search for a solution with a lower waste metric (using that as another bound) until either it has searched all possibilities or runs into the maximum allowed tries.",

    "body": "See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10637#issuecomment-370539486 for updated results\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI figured out how to run simulations with this. https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/tree/bnb-simulate contains the modifications and script that I am using to simulate the behavior. It uses the test framework to setup 2 nodes. One node will then mine a bunch of blocks and send money to the other node as the scenarios specify. Then the other node will spend from those UTXOs as the scenario specifies. At the end, a bunch of data is printed out.\r\n\r\nAll of this is done in `test/functional/simulate-coinselection.py`. Modify that file as necessary if you wan to run simulations.\r\n\r\nThere is also a modification there to print to the debug.log about whether BnB was used or not. To calculate the BnB usage, grep through the debug.log file. This will require running the simulation with `--nocleanup` so that the datadir is not removed after it completes.\r\n\r\nI simulated BnB and compared that to the current coin selection behavior (cherry-picked the above commit and removed the printing to debug.log part). I used set the following parameters: `-dustrelayfee=0 -paytxfee=0.00001000`. Setting the dust relay fee to 0 is to allow the dust UTXOs to be added. The transaction fee rate was set to be a fixed 1 sat/byte.\r\n\r\nThe data from the above simulation is as follows:\r\n\r\n | type | parameters | final value | mean #UTXO | final #UTXO | #received | #spent | #changes created | min change | max change | mean change | stDev of change | total fees | average fees | fees to spend remaining UTXO | total cost | min input set | max input set | mean size of input set | stdev of input set size | BnB usage\r\n | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n | BnB+Core | -dustrelayfee=0 -paytxfee=0.00001000 | 55.87655934 | 26.98596647546917637328078853897750377655029296875 | 32 | 6097 | 17925 | 11860 | 0.00001974 | 10.29131674 | 0.30048583 | 0.75408013 | -0.03577980 | -0.0000030168465 | -0.00004736000000000000734363958532213700891588814556598663330078125 | \u22120.03582716 | 1 | 24 | 1.511382799325463821560333599336445331573486328125 | 1.178462287842233724433071984094567596912384033203125 | 325/11860\r\n | Core | -dustrelayfee=0 -paytxfee=0.00001000 | 55.87654898 | 28.122459208108256945024550077505409717559814453125 | 25 | 6097 | 17932 | 11860 | 0.00011634 | 10.30079774 | 0.30304566 | 0.71006768 | -0.03579016 | -0.0000030177201 | -0.00003700000000000000489018547877861919914721511304378509521484375 | \u22120.03582716 | 1 | 20 | 1.5119730185497470831279542835545726120471954345703125 | 1.2052006592284258967850973931490443646907806396484375 | N/A\r\n\r\nThe results from this aren't very impressive, and that's likely because the BnB algorithm was used for a very small percentage of the coin selections, less than 3%.

    "body": "@achow101 the axes are - X is how \"tight\" the target is - by which I mean, I took the cost of change and I multiplied it by a factor. So I took cost of change just X% of the cost in the original algorithm.\r\n\r\nY is total cost from Murch thesis (what is spent + what it costs to spend the resulting utxos).\r\n\r\nBtw. I wrote @Xekyo  it would be nice to make a BIP with this algorithm, so we don't have to write \"Murch algorithm\" and have the algorithm specified as a BIP. (There are already BIPs that don't describe the protocol, just wallet behaviour.)",

Are you using the solution of the RandomSelector if it has a lower waste metric? Otherwise, I'd expect the BnB usage to increase with higher fees since the target window for a solution without a change output increases.\r\n\r\nThe minChange of 0.00005428 also seems oddly low. Did the wallet balance dip to zero in your simulation?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI've had another idea for an optimization of the exploration: We see a lot of unspent values duplicated at round figures (e.g. 0.1 BTC, 10,000 sats). When exploring the combination tree, we should never allow a second branch to place the same value in the same position.\r\n\r\nE.g. before, when you would have the unspent set of one UTXO with 1,000,000 and 100 UTXO with  100,000, and are looking for a target of 1,150,000,\r\nyou'd explore:\r\n1,000,000\r\n/     \\\r\n      100,000(A)\r\n       /   \\\r\n     0   100,000(B) -----> \u03a3=1,200,000 --> too much, cut branch\r\n       \\\r\n      100,000(C) -----> \u03a3=1,200,000 --> too much, cut branch\r\n\u2026\r\nand once you've tried all 99 other 100 with 100,000(A), you'd try the remaining 98 100,000s with 100,000(B) and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we don't allow expanding a branch that has the same value at the same position this becomes:\r\n\r\n1,000,000\r\n/     \\\r\n|     100,000(A)\r\n|      /   \\\r\n|    0   100,000(B) -----> \u03a3=1,200,000 --> too much, cut branch\r\n|      \\\r\n|     100,000(C-CV) -----> don't expand, already considered 100,000 in combo with this 0th and 1st\r\n|\r\n100,000(B-CV) ----->  don't expand, already considered 100,000 in combo with this 0th\r\nDone, no solution.\r\n\r\nIn practice this could be implemented by remembering the value of the last item that we backtracked from and requiring that any new UTXO we consider for that position is at least one satoshi smaller.",

    "body": "> Row 4 has \"min input set\" of 0, but a transaction must have at least one input.\r\n\r\nThat's strange. I'll rerun that simulation.\r\n\r\n> Why do you think did the BnB usage almost halve?\r\n\r\nI think that's a consequence of the bug I fixed. The BnB usage in the previous simulations was the number of times that BnB was hit, but BnB wasn't actually used for the actual coin selection; the normal normal coin selector was used. So some inputs weren't actually consumed, and additional change outputs were created which would then allow for more hits with BnB as there are more UTXOs.\r\n\r\n> Are you using the solution of the RandomSelector if it has a lower waste metric\r\n\r\nNo, the random selector is not implemented yet.\r\n\r\n> The minChange of 0.00005428 also seems oddly low. Did the wallet balance dip to zero in your simulation?\r\n\r\nI believe it did. Such low values of min change do line up with the min change values for the normal coin selector though.\r\n\r\n> When exploring the combination tree, we should never allow a second branch to place the same value in the same position.\r\n\r\nWe still need to take into account the waste though; two outputs with the same effective value could still have different waste values which may make one output more desireable than another even with the same values. When we backtrack, we aren't always cutting off a branch; we could have backtracked in order to find something else with a lower waste value.",

During times of low fees, they'd be used both during BnB and knapsack, during times of high fees, they wouldn't bloat the blocks and lose their owner money.",

I think you shouldn't pass in nFeeRet at all, but have some explicit signal (e.g. boolean return) for BNB usage and if its set; after select coins set nFeeRet to nChange and use the same signal to bypass this branch.\r\n\r\nI also think this condition is slightly incorrect but benign in the current code, lets say our configured feerate were zero: now BNB could find a solution and leave nFeeRet==0.

It is an exact match algorithm where the exact match\n+ * is a range with the lower bound being the value we want to spend and the upper bound being that value plus the additional cost\n+ * required to create and spend a change output. To do this, the algorithm builds a binary tree where each node is a UTXO and whether\n+ * that UTXO is included or not in the current coin selection. The tree is searched in include-first order. Each UTXO is first included\n+ * and the current selection is evaluated for whether it is within the current threshold. If it is over the threshold, we try excluding\n+ * the UTXO previously added and the branch of the tree involving its inclusion is then not explored. This process is repeated until\n+ * a solution is found (i.e. selected value falls within the range), the exhaustion limit is reached, or the tree is exhausted and no\n+ * solution was found.\n+ *\n+ * To find the best possible solution, we use a waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs\n+ * now minus the cost to spend the current inputs later, plus the amount exceeding the target value. We search the tree to find the\n+ * set of UTXOs which falls within our range and minimizes waste.\n+ *\n+ * An additional optimization of this algorithm implemented here is a lookahead value which maintains the total value of the UTXO set\n+ * of all unexplored UTXOs (i.e. UTXOs that have not yet been included or excluded). This allows us to cut a branch if the remaining\n+ * amount is not sufficient to reach our target.\n+ *\n+ * SelectCoinsBnB Arguments:\n+ * const std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool -> The set of UTXOs that we are choosing from.

It is an exact match algorithm where the exact match\n+ * is a range with the lower bound being the value we want to spend and the upper bound being that value plus the additional cost\n+ * required to create and spend a change output. To do this, the algorithm builds a binary tree where each node is a UTXO and whether\n+ * that UTXO is included or not in the current coin selection. The tree is searched in include-first order. Each UTXO is first included\n+ * and the current selection is evaluated for whether it is within the target range. If it is over the threshold, we try excluding\n+ * the UTXO previously added and the branch of the tree involving its inclusion is then not explored. This process is repeated until\n+ * a solution is found (i.e. selected value falls within the range), the exhaustion limit is reached, or the tree is exhausted and no\n+ * solution was found.\n+ *\n+ * To find the best possible solution, we use a waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs\n+ * now minus the cost to spend the current inputs later, plus the amount exceeding the target value. We search the tree to find the\n+ * set of UTXOs which falls within our range and minimizes waste.\n+ *\n+ * An additional optimization of this algorithm implemented here is a lookahead value which maintains the total value of the UTXO set\n+ * of all unexplored UTXOs (i.e. UTXOs that have not yet been included or excluded).

To do this, the algorithm builds a binary tree where each node is a UTXO and whether\n+ * that UTXO is included or not in the current coin selection. The tree is searched in include-first order.

Doing this would also make the later \"Have SelectCoinsMinConf and SelectCoins use BnB or Knapsack\" (f93ae0c1d3476bfe7d3460d46179998eeda0cd46) commit simpler.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, though, the main change here is dropping the output.fSpendable, output.nDepth, output.tx IsFromMe and TransactionWithinChainLimit checks that were in SelectCoinsMinConf. Other than that, changes made to this code are:\r\n\r\n- renaming setCoinsRet to out_set, nValueRet to value_ret, etc\r\n- sorting coins in descending order instead of sorting then reversing",

    "body": "I'd like to suggest the following for the above description:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the Branch and Bound Coin Selection algorithm designed by Murch. It searches for an input set that can pay for the spending target and does not exceed the spending target by more than the cost of creating and spending a change output. The algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission of a UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first. At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.\r\n\r\nThe search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing the waste metric.  The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:\r\n\r\n   waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs \u00d7 (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\r\n\r\nThe algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test equivalent combinations. This allows us to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an omitted predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis: https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf\r\n\r\nEdit: Cherrypicked first and third of instagibbs changes from below. ;)",

UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first.\n+ * At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the\n+ * target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from\n+ * this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored\n+ * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.\n+ *\n+ * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing\n+ * the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long\n+ * term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:\n+ *\n+ * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs \u00d7 (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\n+ *\n+ * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations.

It searches for an input set that can pay for the\n+ * spending target and does not exceed the spending target by more than the cost of creating and spending a change output. The\n+ * algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission\n+ * of a UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first.\n+ * At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the\n+ * target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from\n+ * this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored\n+ * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.\n+ *\n+ * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing\n+ * the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long\n+ * term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:\n+ *\n+ * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs \u00d7 (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\n+ *\n+ * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree\n+ * is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test\n+ * equivalent combinations. This allows us to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an \n+ * omitted predecessor.\n+ *\n+ * The Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis: https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf\n+ *\n+ * SelectCoinsBnB Arguments:",

The way the code uses `depth` variable to select coins from beginning and `backtrack` variable to deselect coins from the end is pretty  unusual (or at least is something I never encountered before). For example, if there are three coins, and no optimizations apply, the coin selections that get tested are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n000\r\n100\r\n110\r\n111\r\n110\r\n100\r\n101\r\n100\r\n000\r\n010\r\n011\r\n010\r\n000\r\n001\r\n000\r\n```",

The\n+ * algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission\n+ * of a UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first.\n+ * At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the\n+ * target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from\n+ * this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored\n+ * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.\n+ *\n+ * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing\n+ * the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long\n+ * term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:\n+ *\n+ * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs \u00d7 (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\n+ *\n+ * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree\n+ * is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test\n+ * equivalent combinations. This allows us to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an\n+ * omitted predecessor.\n+ *\n+ * The Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis: https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf\n+ *\n+ * @param const std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool -> The set of UTXOs that we are choosing from.

The\n+ * algorithm uses a depth-first search on a binary tree. In the binary tree, each node corresponds to the inclusion or the omission\n+ * of a UTXO. UTXOs are sorted by their effective values and the trees is explored deterministically per the inclusion branch first.\n+ * At each node, the algorithm checks whether the selection is within the target range. While the selection has not reached the\n+ * target range, more UTXOs are included. When a selection's value exceeds the target range, the complete subtree deriving from\n+ * this selection can be omitted. At that point, the last included UTXO is deselected and the corresponding omission branch explored\n+ * instead. The search ends after the complete tree has been searched or after a limited number of tries.\n+ *\n+ * The search continues to search for better solutions after one solution has been found. The best solution is chosen by minimizing\n+ * the waste metric. The waste metric is defined as the cost to spend the current inputs at the given fee rate minus the long\n+ * term expected cost to spend the inputs, plus the amount the selection exceeds the spending target:\n+ *\n+ * waste = selectionTotal - target + inputs \u00d7 (currentFeeRate - longTermFeeRate)\n+ *\n+ * The algorithm uses two additional optimizations. A lookahead keeps track of the total value of the unexplored UTXOs. A subtree\n+ * is not explored if the lookahead indicates that the target range cannot be reached. Further, it is unnecessary to test\n+ * equivalent combinations. This allows us to skip testing the inclusion of UTXOs that match the effective value and waste of an\n+ * omitted predecessor.\n+ *\n+ * The Branch and Bound algorithm is described in detail in Murch's Master Thesis: https://murch.one/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf\n+ *\n+ * @param const std::vector<CInputCoin>& utxo_pool -> The set of UTXOs that we are choosing from.
