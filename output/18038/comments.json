    "body": "@ariard \r\n\r\n> If I understand well this PR, it introduces a initial-broadcast reattempt mechanism through mempool tracking and GETDATA monitoring. Compare to wallet rebroadcast, the safety catch of new one isn't confirmation-based but network-based so once you have reasonable propagation (reasonable=1) you stop initial-broadcast. \r\n\r\nYup. \r\n\r\n> But I don't grasp where the privacy win is in itself, I would say that's a reliability improvement against network unknowns\r\n\r\n**The privacy improvement is due to wallet rebroadcasts being less frequent.** Updated to ~1/day (between 12-36 hrs) instead of ~1/15 mins (between 0-30mins). The current wallet rebroadcast logic deanonymizes the sender, but is important to ensure the initial delivery in some cases. So, we extract the two functions.\r\n\r\nAlso updated OP to try to make this clearer. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell summarizes the motivation pretty well [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#issuecomment-571399346): \r\n> Has anyone considered significantly increasing the time between rebroadcasts as an additional change (and one that could go in separately much faster)? Particularly once you've performed one successful broadcast per execution additional rebroadcasts usually do nothing except leak data to attackers that frequently reconnect to you-- you won't resend to a host you've sent to before, and its not usually useful to do so. This wouldn't obviate the need to be more intelligent, but it would reduce the bleeding and also make it more acceptable for the rest of the change to be more approximate.\r\n\r\nand in regards to the attack vector,\r\n>  (maybe even a slight worsening because now a spying node only have to be connected to you for REATTEMPT_BROADCAST_INTERVAL instead of ~1/30min, which decrease attacker deployment cost ?)\r\n\r\nBecause of `filterInventoryKnown` logic, its not quite that the attacker needs to be connected to you for that long, but rather that they would need to open a new connection to you during that window of time. Also, my understanding is that the conditions would need to be such that you didn't receive any `GETDATAs` back from any peers in regards to this txn, because otherwise it would be removed from the set. So we'd need: 1. victim sends txn to attacker, 2. attacker doesn't acknowledge with `GETDATA` but notes down txn hash, 3. somehow (either intentional or unintentional) ensure no other peers send back `GETDATA` for the txn 4. open a new connection before next broadcast attempt. Then the attacker can confirm that the victim is the source for that transaction. \r\n\r\nDoes that logic make sense to you? Please poke holes at it :) Or let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAlso, relevant conversation in this comment thread [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#discussion_r348840194), which I know you've seen but might be worth re-visiting. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@ariard - addressing your 2 outstanding review comments\r\n\r\nRE: wtxid - there is some additional code needed to support unbroadcast set & wtxid relay. I'll work on the patch & depending on timing around which PR is ready for merge first, include the patch here or offer it on the other PR. Thanks again for pointing that out :) \r\n\r\nRE: `filterInventoryKnown` - to make this easier to realize, I mention in a comment above `ReattemptInitialBroadcast`. However, I'm hesitant to impose too much interpretation in the code comments or commit messages, because I want to encourage independent thinking that might conflict with or challenge my own interpretation. Also because there are so many interactions it's kind of impossible to encapsulate them all, and they will also change over time.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific..\r\n> If no GETDATA is processed before mempool initial-broadcast\r\nreattempt period expires, a new announcement is made to every peer. Due\r\nto inventory filter, this is only effective for new peers since last period\r\nexpiration.\r\n\r\nThis is the normal condition, but iirc `filterInventoryKnown` is cleared out based on number of transactions, so maybe under super high traffic network conditions, an announcement is resent to the same peer? \r\n\r\nAnd in regards to the second part of your comment, I don't quite follow..\r\n> Transaction origin privacy would only be worsened if a) among\r\nnew nodes there is a spying one \r\n\r\nSay you have a set of unbroadcast transactions. You attempt initial broadcast, but your wifi is disconnected so they don't go anywhere, but get inserted into `filterInventoryKnown` for your existing connections. A malicious node connects to you. `ReattemptInitialBroadcast` is triggered & you send your wallet transaction to this node. At that time, the node cannot identify that is your transaction with certainty. For it to carry out an attack, it needs to be the ONLY node you submitted the transaction to. Which is possible, but a specific subset of this condition.\r\n\r\n> b) no honest/reliable peers reported back\r\na GETDATA. Given the mempool rebroadcast period length, if b) occurs, that\r\nwould be a clue of bigger concern.\r\n(but if b) occurs that's a reliability improvement IMO)\r\n\r\nso, there are two main reasons a node wouldn't report back a `GETDATA`. Either network issues (it didn't receive announcement, you didn't receive the `GETDATA`). Or it is malicious. If it is occurring because of network issues, it makes sense to try again. Is this the reliability improvement that you are talking about? because thats the main point of this PR :) ",

    "body": "Do we have any numbers on how important wallet rebroadcasting is? I have a small concern that stopping the \"fast\" initial broadcast after a single successful transmission may sometimes not be enough (e.g. the peer it's sent to goes offline before forwarding it further). This seems unlikely to happen (both we only submitting once, and them failing immediately afterwards), and even if it happens, it wouldn't be a disaster as the once per day rebroadcast would still occur.\r\n\r\nBesides that, concept and code review ACK.",

    "body": "thanks for the review @sipa! \r\n\r\nunfortunately, I don't have any real-life numbers of wallet rebroadcast usage for getting a transaction initially broadcast. I'd love relevant data. (anyone reading this... ) please let me know if you have any ideas of how I could get relevant info. \r\n\r\nI've mostly been operating in theoretical possibility space & have come to the same conclusion- the likelihood seems slim & there's an additional safety net. in this implementation, it'd be possible to increase the guarantee (eg. ensure we fulfill two `GETDATA` requests instead of one), but the tradeoff hasn't seemed worth it.

    "body": "thanks for the reviews @MarcoFalke, @jnewbery & @fjahr \r\n\r\nI've addressed all review comments. Fixed the issues with raciness around dumping & loading unbroadcast set to `mempool.dat`. Updated so `m_unbroadcast_txids` is private & exposes public methods to add / remove / get the set. And a bunch of small nit fixes. \r\n\r\n@fjahr \r\n> The underlying assumption here seems to be that all nodes are online 24/7 \r\n\r\n>  it seems like if a first attempt at broadcasting the tx fails, the user would need to remember that and relaunch their node ~24h later to retry\r\n\r\n>  now that I am reviewing the code it makes more sense\r\n\r\nok, maybe you're clear now but just incase / for other reviewers..\r\n\r\nif we were to simply bump the wallet rebroadcast from ~1/30 min to ~1/day, we would have exactly the problem you describe. so we introduce the idea of the \"unbroadcast\" set to the mempool. instead of using wallet \"rebroadcast\" logic to do best effort of first delivery, we now use the mempool \"unbroadcast\" logic to serve this function. it does work a bit differently (tries more frequently & keeps trying until a `GETDATA` is received or txn is removed from mempool for a different reason), so reviewers should be critical about the changes.",

    "body": "thank you for the reviews everyone! \ud83d\ude4f \r\n\r\nThe current tip `50fc4df` currently has 6 ACKs on it, so I've opened #18807 to address the last bits. \r\n\r\n@jonatack \r\n\r\n> ISTM #16698 (comment) should be mentioned up-front in the PR description as well as a co-author mention in the relevant commit\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve updated the PR description to reflect this but I disagree that a co-author mention is necessary in this case. Crediting in-depth conceptual review would be quite a tall task given how helpful people are around here :) \r\n\r\n> if the work in @ariard\u2019s commit 2d8ae9a was used, it would be kind to pull in the commit\r\n\r\nAgree here. I reached out to @ariard yesterday to ask if he\u2019d like to be added as a co-author & expressed preferring not to invalidate the ACKs. \r\n\r\n> Last but not least, the resend timer has not been changed since e89b9f6 e.g. way back to 2011 or earlier. It seems best to not rush, and to document and preserve the most salient points of the discussion in the code and tests.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should not rush. We are changing a core behavior of the wallet and P2P around how transactions are being broadcast. Having critical review analyze different possible repercussions of this functionality is extremely important. So many thanks to all of the reviewers who have thought critically about these changes \ud83d\ude4c \r\n\r\nI also agree in the value of documentation and testing. I have incorporated the outstanding feedback in the #18807 . I would strongly prefer not to consume reviewers\u2019 time with a re-ACK so hoping further clean-up items can go there.\r\n",

    "body": "It might. Which upholds the same guarantees as the previous logic it's replacing.\r\n\r\nOn current master, wallet transactions get rebroadcast through a scheduler flow that makes its way to `ResendWalletTransactions`, which selects transactions to rebroadcast then invokes `SubmitMemoryPoolAndRelay`. This goes to `BroadcastTransaction`, which checks ATMP then relays via `RelayTransaction`, which uses the `CNode#PushInventory` function that only adds the hash if its not contained in `filterInventoryKnown`. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the initial parts of the flow... so `BroadcastTransaction` adds the transaction to `mempool.m_unbroadcast_txids`, then there is a scheduled job to periodically `AttemptInitialBroadcast`, but the behavior is matched where the locally-submitted transactions would be reattempted to send to the network, filtered for the connections that were already tried, and sent out to new connections.\r\n\r\nChanging that behavior could be desirable for robustness but of course reduces privacy. So out of scope for this PR. If you think it may be desirable, I'd be happy to think it through / talk about it more, we can open a new issue. (I'm working on the assumption that current delivery guarantees are sufficient). ",

I remember in an earlier discussion you mentioned that a user might disconnect their wifi. A tx might get added to filterInventoryKnown, but then never sent out.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is true. Either, we reconnect the wifi and be still connected to the peer, in which case we can push the inv out and wait for them to request the tx. Or, we drop the peer (either because the wifi isn't turned on again, or it took us too long to do so), in which case a new peer will pop up and they will receive the inv (after 10-15 minutes).",

    "body": "> but the version shouldn't be bumped because that will silently drop all transactions of the mempool\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke - this is interesting. It means if we ever have to bump the version number we'd have to do something like:\r\n\r\n- Bitcoin Core version X only understands mempool.dat v1\r\n- add mempool.dat v2 parsing logic in Bitcoin Core version X+1\r\n- add mempoo.dat v2 writing logic in Bitcoin Core version X+2\r\n\r\nI think to avoid the debug LogPrint we can wrap the m_unbroadcast_txids parsing in its own try-except. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        try {\r\n            LOCK(pool.cs);\r\n            file >> pool.m_unbroadcast_txids;\r\n            unbroadcast = pool.m_unbroadcast_txids.size();\r\n        } catch (const std::exception& e) {\r\n            // mempool.dat files created prior to v0.21 will not have an\r\n            // unbroadcast set. No need to log a failure if parsing fails\r\n            // here.\r\n        }\r\n```",

I'm thinking as a small followup I can have `P2PTxInvStore` call through to the parent `on_inv` after it stores the txid to behave more as expected. what do you think?  ",

This is only in C++, and makes it possible to have code in header files (as it will end up in every module that includes it). Member functions defined in classes *always* have this implicitly, no need to add the \"inline\" keyword for it (unless you also want to hinting effect above).\r\n\r\nSo the only time you *have to* use `inline` is for functions in headers files that are not member functions.",

I think I'm understanding- its a clue to the compiler to try expanding in line, as well as an indicator that the symbol defined in more than one translation unit are the same, which the compiler can enforce. when a member function is defined, not just declared, within the class definition- the compiler automatically interprets this as an inline member function. so, the keyword `inline` in the implementation I have here is redundant.

So the comment is indeed wrong and it just \"accidentally\" works because `P2PTxInvStore` doesn't send a `GETDATA`. I think I would expect it to send a `GETDATA` because it is part of the framework now, but in general, I think the `P2PInterface` is there so you can override the behavior to be what you need so I don't have a strong feeling about it. If it was part of the test I would say it doesn't matter but because it moves to the framework, slight preference to call the super behavior.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For reference, I mean this line: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038/files#diff-5e6f5e6aab04f82ec4b58148c4bdec72R85 the linking isn't working properly because I commented on an outdated conversation.",

    "body": "Yes that's a good point, in LN there is class of transaction where txid is known from remote party due to the fact they counter-sign them (HTLC-timeout) but honest party have to broadcast with time-constrain to avoid any risk of money-loss.\r\n\r\nRight now most of implementations are pretty aggressive at triggering rebroadcast at every block, i.e calling again `sendrawtransaction` which isn't great for privacy and this may change in the future. That said, often offline nodes, like mobile, won't use core as a backend and broadcast directly their transaction on the p2p layer or submit to a third-party server. Routing nodes assumed to run core, should rebroadcast at every block so it would override some attacker messing with their unbroadcast logic.\r\n\r\nI think adopting wtxid would solve this issue because counterparty won't know about witness, at least for LN. But I agree, we should document this to keep track (add a comment commit on top or as a follow-up)",

I've added it to the follow up todos here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18807#issue-410374742.\r\n\r\nbut not sure how what you're proposing would lead to being able to change this test? because this test is verifying the _reason_ the txn was removed from unbroadcast set. If we just check that its no longer in the set, we don't know if its because of another reason like processing a `GETDATA` ",

If so, in a future change would it make sense to either (i) document the necessary timing assumptions, or (ii) update the test to depend less on particular timings?",
