    "body": "> I think adding asserts should be making it clearer for people to see why the code is safe as well as automated tools.\r\n\r\nI agree about that statement :)\r\n\r\nIn _addition_ to that use I _also_ think assertions can be useful to get deterministic termination in case where we otherwise would get a null pointer dereference (if our assumption of non-null turns out to be false).\r\n\r\nWhy is that desired?\r\n\r\nOne might think that a null pointer dereference is guaranteed to lead to immediate termination. Unfortunately that is not the case: deterministic termination is the best outcome. Another possible outcome is what in the literature is called \"optimization-unsafety\" which can be problematic from a security perspective.\r\n\r\nThere is a neat paper covering optimization-safe code called [\"Towards Optimization-Safe Systems: Analyzing the Impact of Undefined Behavior\"](https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/440h/papers/stack.pdf) which I recommend for context.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think adding assertions can be handy as a cheap way to avoid some instances of potentially \"optimization-unsafe code\". That is my personal opinion: I know others might not agree and that is fine of course :)\r\n\r\n> (If you are getting this from an automated tool, are there reports from it around? I remember there were previously somewhere)\r\n\r\nIIRC Coverity and [Clang's Cross Translation Unit (CTU)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17454) static analysis flag these cases. I think most static analysers doing pointer analysis would flag at least some of these since it is non-trivial for them to infer non-`nullptr` in these cases AFAICT. I wouldn't be surprised if PVS Studio and cppcheck flags these too as an example.\r\n\r\nI don't have any reports readily available, but feel free to check the instructions in #18920 for instructions on how to get Bitcoin Core reports from Clang Static Analysis, clang-tidy and cppcheck. It only takes a couple of minutes of setup :)\r\n\r\nHope that helps! :)",

Might be better to put the `Assert` there?\r\n\r\nThere are other places where we assume `ChainActive().Tip()` is non-null (ie, we immediately dereference it), but at a quick glance I couldn't assure myself that was actually always true. Might be better to actually make it always true (and add a non-null attribute on the response?).",
