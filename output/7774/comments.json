The version makes more sense to me quickly when it's in hex, that's all.\nFor example:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6440430/14162821/87528604-f6bd-11e5-9d72-5dd967da0d3e.png)\n\nAnd yes, the type changes from number to string because in JSON, \"the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used\" [http://www.json.org/].\n\nActually, I suppose that just adding this as \"version_hex\" would be just as well. I might do that later.\n",

    "body": "That sounds pretty good although I'm hesitant to use the terminology that overlaps with BIP9. For example, there are two more possible future mechanisms where a hex encoding might also be helpful (and I think some BIP101 blocks used something very close or similar to BIP9 IIRC). So, how about versionHex: 'ffff0000'. That is obvious enough to drop the `0x` and still generic enough that I don't have to apply BIP specific logic to it or create another field in the far future. The only decision is whether to show this field for versions 1-4. I'm leaning towards not showing it for versions 1-4.\n",

    "body": "I agree with @luke-jr.\nThis is a number, keep passing it as a number. Client software can format it to the user however they want.\n(we do this consistently in other places too; e.g. we even report timestamps as numbers, and don't bother formatting them as date-times)\n\nIt's certainly not worth breaking the interface for. Also realize that a client may need this value to process further, not to show to the user: e.g. bitwise-AND operations should be done on a number, not a string, so this change may mean doing an _extra_ conversion from hex to int on the client side.\n\nNo strong opposition to adding it as extra field, though I'd still say adding a field to avoid an extra hex conversion on the client side is too much hand-holding. This shouldn't set a precedent to add hex, octal, binary for every field.\n",

    "body": "I went ahead and added the extra data to `bip9_softforks` in `getblockchaininfo`.\n\nThe first thing to decide was if/when to show the bit information.\nSince the relevant bit information for a given block version changes over time, it would be confusing to always show the bit info for every soft fork that was ever defined with this mechanism.\nIt's actually not quite as straightforward as I guessed it would be.\nFor example, BIP9 gives the guidance:\n\n\"Miners should continue setting the bit in LOCKED_IN phase so uptake is visible, though this has no effect on consensus rules.\"\n\n\"There could be two non-overlapping deployments on the same bit, where the first one transitions to LOCKED_IN while the other one simultaneously transitions to STARTED, which would mean both would demand setting the bit.\"\n\n\"Once the consensus change succeeds or times out, there is a \"fallow\" pause after which the bit can be reused for later changes.\"\n\nAlthough the plan is to have a fallow period, due to consensus allowing a locked in bit to be immediately reused, it might not really be safe for a miner to continue setting the bit.\nEDIT: this is also feedback to @sipa about `ComputeBlockVersion` continuing to set the version bit during LOCKED_IN, assuming my understanding of BIP9 is correct.\nThus, it might not make sense to show the info for a locked in soft fork even though during normal operations, the fallow period is observed and it would make sense to give a user the info.\n\nSo, I took the conservative approach and decided to only show the bit info during an active voting period, that is when the soft fork is in state STARTED.\nThis gives an indication to users that if the hex block version is other than 20000000 and no info is shown in `bip9_softforks`, then either everything is locked in, or there is fork voting going on for something the node software being used does not know about.\n\nI left the condition as a separate block in-case we decide to change it to `THRESHOLD_STARTED == thresholdState || THRESHOLD_LOCKED_IN == thresholdState`. I figured I'd throw this out there and see what other people thought.\n",

It can't be complete, but it can show the known ones. Tons of options for the unknown ones, one would be to show them as 'unknownXX' where XX is the bit. E.g. in UpdateTip logging we issue a warning per block, see #7795.\n\nIMO where to coordinate the bits is completely offtopic here :) It shouldn't happen in our repository at all, but indeed in BIPs.\n\n@mruddy Sounds good to me.\n",

I wanted to avoid redundancy for the easy to ascertain version numbers that are definitely treated as integers.\n\nI was trying to avoid being too specific to BIP9 because it allows for two future mechanisms (top bits 010 and 011). I thought of using `>= VERSIONBITS_TOP_BITS`, but that ignores [5, 0x1fffffff] which I think could be re-purposed too. I don't see any rule limiting that range's use to only being simple integers.\n\nI should probably just keep it simple and always display `versionHex`. My redundancy limiting kinda feels like unnecessary optimization.\n",
