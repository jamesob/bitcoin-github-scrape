Banning after getting 10 invalid-signature-alerts prevents that.\n\nMostly not a practical attack, most nodes are bandwidth-constrained not CPU-constrained. But I could imagine attacking a VPS running in a datacenter from another machine in the same datacenter.\n\nIn any case, if others think this should be done then there should be a regression test to make sure bitcoind doesn't behave badly if it gets a bunch of zero-size alerts with bad signatures, max-message-size-alerts with bad signatures, etc.....\n",
