The prior philosophy seems to have been to show the value pushed to the stack, not the specific encoding of the value. With your change one still can't distinguish the different pushdata forms and while the non-pushdata numbers are more clear, I'm concerned that it might be at the expense of making it less clear what ends up on the stack (E.g. \"OP_1NEGATE\" doesn't end up on the stack, -1 does).\n",
