If the rpc only ever returns a small number of addresses, it should be easy enough for the client to receive the full list of balances and then filter the list itself?\r\n- if there's a chance that this functionality needs to be extended further to filter on a list of addresses rather than a single address, it'd be better to include that now. Since #8811 , the arguments to the RPCs are part of the API, so changing them later becomes more troublesome. Perhaps change the `only_address` string to a `filter_addresses` array?\r\n\r\nI've also added a few nits.",

However we there are times in which we only want to learn the status of a single address.\r\n\r\nSorting received transactions by address is a common enough usecase to have an RPC call. It seems likely that people are calling it and then writing filters to select the addresses they want (for instance [this stackexchange question](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/14170/is-there-a-json-rpc-method-for-retrieving-all-transactions-for-a-given-address) or [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4ww82e/bitcoin_core_rpc_how_to_filter_transactions_by/)). It is an natural addition to the RPC API and one that would make our project and other projects more performant and cleaner.",
