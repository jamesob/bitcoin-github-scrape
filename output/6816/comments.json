    "body": "The deployment times of concrete softforks depend on the chain (ie they are expected to be different in main and testnet3). Here's one solution:\n\n1) The Softfork class moves to consensus/params.h (and becomes a method-less struct, since that file is expected to be exposed to a complete libconsensus). \n\n2) Consensus::Params gets a new field softforks, which is an array of these new Softfork structs, and whose static size is determined by MAX_SOFTFORKS, the last element of an enumeration of all currently supported softforks.\n\n3) Every time a new softfork is supported, it must be included in that enum and the static size of the array will increase.\n\nThis way we maintain the ability to independently deploy different softforks in different testchains while respecting Consensus::Params as the only interface to communicate differences between chains to the consensus code (a problem we had already solved, in a way that is compatible with a C API).\n",

Little by little I want to get to what I suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6816#issuecomment-148043500 .

In the future if we ever decide to change the threshold, it will be straightforward to do so without requiring any changes to the implementation while allowing us to keep the old thresholds for the earlier forks. The BIP document mentions the possibility of modifying the threshold at some point in the future. So I don't see any downside in supplying this parameter for each fork.\n\nAdding the parameter to Consensus::Params means that if we ever decide to support a different threshold we'll have to hack around it, which seems completely unnecessary when the current implementation can already cleanly support it.\n",
