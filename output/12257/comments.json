It may be reasonable to switch to simply using 'number of inputs' rather than 'absolute fee', in which case this can be moved to `SelectCoins`, but I already did the opposite change as input count was deemed to be a bit too crude.\r\n\r\nEdit: I should note that I ended up moving `CoinEligibilityFilter` to `coinselection.h`, which I think makes perfect sense.",

If you just take the max across all coins in an output group, then if you have e.g. 30 2-ancestor coins in an output group, you may treat them as a 2-ancestor output group, when in fact you have 60 ancestors in any transaction that includes the group.\r\n\r\n(For descendants, I think this works out fine, because all we're doing by creating a new transaction is adding one more descendant to every ancestor, so considering the max value is sufficient to try to avoid hitting mempool chain limits.)\r\n\r\nI understand that the existing logic may be imprecise and hacky around this, but I believe that combining all the coins into an output group exacerbates this issue.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what we end up doing here though I think the code could use a comment explaining the logic, as this is non-obvious.",

If you just take the max across all coins in an output group, then if you have e.g. 30 2-ancestor coins in an output group, you may treat them as a 2-ancestor output group, when in fact you have 60 ancestors in any transaction that includes the group.\r\n\r\nAha!
