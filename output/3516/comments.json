    "body": "No, receiving orphans is very expected and one of the reason why I'm working on headers-first.\n\nThe problem is that any peer that announces some blocks, we ask for it, and if it's something whose parent we don't know, we ask for the parents - starting a pretty much full sync process from this peer, even if we were already syncing from another before. The problem is just that if you're syncing from two peers at once, some ranges of blocks are bound to be downloaded in incorrect order.\n\nIt's certainly possible to improve this, and try to prevent starting a second sync from another peer if another is ongoing, but this sounds hard to do right and guarantee to deal well with all weird edge cases that can arise.\n",
