    "body": "@roconnor-blockstream Yeah, I considered something like that, and am open to it. Both notations are equivalent in that you can fairly easily convert in both directions between them (counting bracing level in yours corresponds to the depth specified explicitly in mine, with leaves ultimately listed in the same order). The advantage I see to the current one is that I think it's a bit more readable, avoiding the need to go count braces to see relative depth of leaves. Yours is perhaps a bit easier to write (but maybe that's not something we really expect humans to do much for nontrivial cases).\r\n\r\nThere are many more variations possible. One extreme would be permitting arbitrary weights for every node, and have the descriptor expansion convert it to a Huffman tree. I'd prefer not to do this because it's adding information that can't be inferred back from the script tree it is converted to.",

    "body": "+1 @roconnor-blockstream  a bracketed version seems superior to me.\r\n\r\nSome BIP-level (assuming this would eventually become a BIP) thoughts on things that might be useful in a descriptor:\r\n\r\n1. it might make sense to have a node that's a Need-To-Know-Basis Subtree. N2KBS have some danger -- e.g., could be hiding a backdoor key -- but also can be used to simplify a descriptor for e.g. inter-operating with an Escrow service that you don't want to share the whole program with.\r\n2. I think with brackets it's also easier to attach a subtree modifier. E.g., we could spec the lexing to recognize `[a-zA-Z0-9_]*(` or something similar as a subtree modifier. E.g., `[A,B]` -> `huffman[A@p,B@q]`. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of having this baked in is great for readability -- often times you might want to express a tree as:\r\n\r\n[Thing that should happen most likely, in the unlikely event that doesn't happen, Other thing that could happen, other thing we might want to do in unlikely event]\r\n\r\nwhich would -- if depth order is required -- look like:\r\n\r\n [Thing that should happen most likely, Other thing that could happen, in the unlikely event that doesn't happen, other thing we might want to do in unlikely event]\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me of exception throwing where the error handling source code can be very far away from the source of the error (bad). \r\n\r\n(something like huffman does require that we also use a sorted Tree to select clauses lexicographically after probability).\r\n3. An annotation/tag interface that would allow you to do something like `[A#{escrow, alice, bob}, B#{alice, bob}]` which when 'blind_for(\"escrow\")' is called creates the `[A, N2KB]` descriptor.\r\n4. Maybe a more general way of inserting extended structured metadata that Core will store/pass along but might not understand for supporting things like 3...\r\n5. a `opaque[]` annotation, which compiles a subtree opaquely to any parent modifiers. This would be useful in contexts where a subtree might be known entirely already by another party and we want to preserve that structure\r\n",

    "body": "@JeremyRubin I agree that there is a potential use for omitted subtrees, but I don't think there is much of a difference between the two approaches there? In the current approach you'd just specify the Merkle root of the omitted subtree as a \"leaf\" at the depth that root exists at.\r\n\r\nAll the other things you mention seem to be things for a policy language that get compiled to descriptors rather than descriptors themselves. Descriptors are for encoding information potentially needed by signers; I can't imagine a need for information of that kind that applies a specific subtree (rather than applying to individual leaves, or to the entire tree).\r\n\r\nThat said, it's not hard to implement a nested-bracket approach; I'll try to implement that too so people can experiment with both.\r\n\r\nMy main reason for having a slight preference for the explicit depth style is that I think `tr(KEY,[A|[[B|C]|D]])` is much harder to interpret by a human than `tr(KEY,1:A,3:B,3:C,2:D)`. In the latter it's immediately clear that B and C are the least likely paths, and A is the most likely one, for example. I agree with the argument that it's harder to write, but I'm not sure that's a big problem; for nontrivial things I suspect they'll either be written once as a template, or generated from a higher-level specification.",

    "body": "I think it just depends on what descriptors are for v.s. what people end up using them for. Of that I am unsure, but it's worthwhile to note that this is a human readable format so presumably at some point a human may look at it or want to edit it.\r\n\r\nw.r.t. annotations for \"descriptor blinding\", I actually think this is somewhat relevant. One could imagine a scenario where a branch is used both as a pre-image for a has revelation and as a script. In that case, you might not want to reveal the entire tree to someone as it might give them the ability to spend from that branch as well. \r\n\r\nw.r.t. brackets or list, it might be interesting to make the descriptors a NEWICK format subset, which seems to be the most commonly used tree format (and is a bracket based format). Then you could dump descriptors into standard tree viewing software easily.

    "body": "@Sjors That's expected, and I don't really know how to deal with this. The problem is that we determine the fee for spending an output by using the dummy signer, but the dummy signer can't know which private keys will and won't be available. Since tr spending cost differs based on what is available, this will give an inaccurate result (it'll always just use the key path).\r\n\r\nA possibility is extending descriptors with markers to indicate that certain keys won't ever be available. It's good to point this out, but I think the scope will take us a bit too far for this PR.",

    "body": "This is definitely a new can of worms that will need some thought, but I agree it can wait (if documented).\r\n\r\nThe main point of having leaves is to be able to spend when the main keypath key material isn't available. But we currently have no way of indicating that.\r\n\r\nI don't think descriptors are the right place for this. Let's say I have 3 hardware wallets. The keypath is a 3-of-3 musig, and the script(s) are 2-of-3. Normally I would sign with all 3 in order to save fees and preserve privacy. But after a minor boating accident I only have two. I wouldn't necessarily want to create a new wallet, so nothing about the descriptors changes.\r\n\r\nThe natural place to indicate which leaf to use is probably the send command (especially fun for the GUI...). From there on it should be straight forward to use the right dummies.",

    "body": "Yeah, I agree with that 100%. What I was thinking was a vec<uint128> where each bit represents a left/right on the tree. That way you can do a de-duplicate check to make sure each node is only occupied once. Then the order of the vec itself is no longer significant; it should not need to be preserved because you can sort them by value (if I'm not wrong) to get the insertion order. Depth could be computed by looking at your nearest neighbor and computing the \"divergence\" (or by encoding an extra byte to make it explicit -- unclear what is best here). \r\n\r\nWith a sorted vec, this also enables some nicesties such as using std:: binary searches for O(log(n)) lookup by tree position.",
