    "body": "> So you also suggest to add interfaces::Node::loadWallet and interfaces::Node::unloadWallet and or alike?\r\n\r\n`loadWallet` might make sense in short term. Longer term with #10102, though I think it would be replaced by a `makeWallet` method in [`interfaces::Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) to allow the GUI to create wallets without going through the node at all.\r\n\r\n`unloadWallet` should probably be avoided in favor of having more flexible shutdown methods on the `Wallet` interface itself and cleanup in the destructor.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, I think there will probably be multiple PRs updating the GUI to support wallet loading and unloading. The first PR might follow up #10740 and use existing `handleLoadWallet` callback to get newly loaded wallets to show up in the GUI. Independently there could be a PR that adds a `handleUnloadWallet` method and removes unloaded wallets in the GUI. And there could be one or two PRs adding GUI controls for loading and unloading wallets adding a new `loadWallet` method. And a cleanup PR could drop `getWallets` after dynamic loading works.\r\n\r\nBut the implementation of all these features will primarily consist of updates to gui and wallet code. Changes to `interfaces/` code should only be one or two line diffs, and basically be an afterthought.\r\n\r\n>> Personally, I would prefer to just manage wallets with standard c++ data structures and synchronization primitives instead of having a management interface\r\n\r\n> In the case of dynamic wallet load/unload that would lead to code duplication right? - UI and RPC layers want to load/unload wallets.\r\n\r\nNo, but this is a bikeshed debate, so please implement what you like! My preference would be to use `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<interfaces::Wallet>>` in the gui code and `std::map<std::string, std::weak_ptr<CWallet>>` in rpc and wallet code, along with plain mutexes and condition variables. But if you and others prefer more layered abstractions in the style of `WalletManager`, more power to you!\r\n\r\n> > But if you'd prefer to have a management interface\r\n\r\n> It's not a matter of my preference. It just makes sense to have such entity like CAddrMan, CConnman and BanMan.\r\n\r\nDisagree, but this is the same bikeshed debate, so again you should feel free to proceed in whatever way makes sense to you. In my opinion, it makes sense to have classes like `AddrMan` and `ConnMan` that manage more complex state, but it doesn't necessarily make sense to have a class that just manages a list of pointers.\r\n\r\n> Also, see PR description for other things that can be handled by WalletManager.\r\n\r\nYeah, I didn't mention it, but this seemed pretty weird to me. This suggests having a bunch of methods that pertain to _individual_ wallets as part of a class that's supposed to be about managing a _list_ of wallets. Again, this is another bikeshed debate: you might prefer a code organization with more nested layers, and I might prefer an code organization with fewer layers, but I don't think the difference is very important, and I do think you should implement what you like.\r\n\r\n> I disagree if these changes make it easy to actually implement and review those features. Historically big PR's lack reviews, have lots of discussions and later are usually split in multiple PR's.\r\n\r\nIt's doesn't seem true to me that introducing WalletManager helps implement process separation or wallet unloading. You should feel free to add it anyway, but I think if you sat down and drew a sequence diagram of how wallet and gui state needs to be updated when an unload request comes in, the data structures and notification mechanisms that should be used, and tradeoffs in layering would become more clear, and you could start implementing features more simply without unnecessarily shuffling a bunch of code around first.",
