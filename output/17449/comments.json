    "body": "> Are there any bounty rewards for these finds?\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin Core project does not have any official bounty program AFAIK, but the is nothing stopping individuals from donating to other individuals who they think have done valuable security research.\r\n\r\n(Aside: My personal view is that we could do a much better job recognising good security research: especially the non-glamorous kind of low-level security research. As an example: if we had a proper incentive structure in place I guess someone would be running `bitcoind` binaries compiled from `master` with `-O{0,1,2}` running under `valgrind` around the clock just waiting to report an issue like this. Incentives matter. Unfortunately I don't know the optimal incentive structure (the mix between public recognition vs official bug bounty vs donations vs just being polite and thanking researchers vs long-term funding, etc.), but I'm fairly certain we're not at the global optimum right now :))\r\n\r\nShameless plug: People interested in running `bitcoind` under `valgrind` might want to help out by reviewing #17455 :)",
