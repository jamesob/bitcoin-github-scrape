I.e. some functions might be executed in a different order or sometimes skipped, but every line, function and branch should be executed at least once.\r\n> \r\n> This is currently not true, even for serialization errors that should be hit exactly once.\r\n> \r\n> Beside the obvious issue of missing test coverage on some runs, this also makes it impossible to see how test coverage changes between two commits.\r\n\r\nMore specifically this PR makes sure line coverage is stable between unit test runs - from the OP of this PR:\r\n\r\n> A necessary condition for meaningful line coverage measuring is that the test suite is deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least once is identical between test suite runs.\r\n\r\nI've now updated the PR title to better reflect the goal of this PR.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke @sdaftuar Just to make sure we share the same goal: we all want line coverage unit tests reports to be deterministic, right? :-)",

It's demoralizing to include a test for something and then have some unrelated script break for spurious reasons that requires learning and investigating something new in order to make travis pass.\r\n\r\nSo I think I'm still a Concept NACK.  I think our concerns about line-coverage, which reflect a goal about the whole project's test suite, should not provide too much inconvenience for contributors working on a smaller piece.",

Assumptions are dangerous :-)\r\n\r\nIf the consensus opinion is that we are okay with the unit test line coverage sometimes being a random process (80,5% on first run, 80,6% on second run, 80,4% on third run, etc.) then this PR is clearly not needed and I'll close :-)",
