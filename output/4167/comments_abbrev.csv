roybadami,2014-05-12T21:00:39Z,"Ok, so I was a bit worried about the convention that I and @leofidus had been researching, where if you have exactly four digits on either side of the decimal point, you omit the thousands separator and just write a group of four.  This would mess up digit alignment in tabular data -- and it would also make it much harder to line up the decimal points.\n\nFortunately, looking at actual real life d",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4167#issuecomment-42887574,42887574,
laanwj,2014-05-13T05:01:06Z,"@roybadami Even scientists can be pragmatic sometimes! But indeed, it makes sense to simply group per three, at least in the overview page and transaction overview, as having the numbers below each other align up is more important here. It's also easier for people to learn this (for many) new convention of grouping digits after the dot if done consistently per three.\n\nTo be honest I'm still a bi",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4167#issuecomment-42917290,42917290,
roybadami,2014-05-17T13:55:51Z,"This was getting messy, so I've squashed to a single commit.  Implemented alignment in the overview and transaction table.  It gets kinda messy though, when combined with the use of [square brackets] to show unconfirmed transactions.  Maybe it's good enough, though?  (Perhaps I could float the closing bracket to the left of the figure spaces in the transaction view?)\n",https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4167#issuecomment-43407477,43407477,
