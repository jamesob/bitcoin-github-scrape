Simple static casts aren't enough, as they don't maintain constness, but I'd be happy to learn about another approach.\n\nEDIT: I've added a rationale to the PR description; you're very right to point out it wasn't sufficient.",

    "body": "> `const Base& i = CastAs<Base>(Derived());`\r\n\r\nSure, but that has nothing to do with the `AsType` construction, I think? This works just as well:\r\n\r\n`const Derived& i = Derived();`\r\n\r\nOr even:\r\n\r\n`const Base& i = Derived();`\r\n\r\n> It just seems like the CastAs construct is unusual and unsafe and something that doesn't really make sense outside of the context of our READWRITE macro.\r\n\r\n~~~Yes, but `READWRITEAS` can't be combined with a READWRITE with multiple arguments at once. It's also harder to compose with other things (which I admittedly don't really have any good use cases for).~~~\r\n\r\n~~~My point is that `AsType` never makes unsafe constructions that were illegal legal, and is thus much less risky to use than `static_cast`.~~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see your point. `const Base& i = Derived()` extends the lifetime of the temporary, while `const Base& i = AsType<Base>(Derived());` does not, making it unsafe to use.\r\n",

My example wasn't safe because lifetime extension can't work in that case. To be sure, I don't actually think this is a big deal. It's just a general reason to be wary of functions like `AsType` which return references that might not have clear lifetimes.",
