    "body": "@harding \r\n\r\n> I really like the idea of BIP322, but I don't like that this changes existing RPCs in way that's not backwards compatible (e.g. a signmessage created and verified on 0.18 produces a \"CDataStream::read(): end of data: iostream error\" here). Similarly, a P2PKH signmessage created on this branch results in false when checked with 0.18. Either P2PKH signing/verifying should be special cased to use the legacy signmessage format, or BIP322 message signing should use different RPCs (or at least a special RPC parameter or configuration option to indicate the user wants to use BIP322).\r\n\r\nI don't really agree. Proving that you own an address is something that you do \"now\", not something you do and keep the proof around indefinitely. Losing an old proof should be perfectly fine, as the point is lost if you can't reproduce it.\r\n\r\nOf course, down the road Craig could claim that his broken proof actually worked, \"but that core changed the mechanism so it can't be verified anymore\" but I don't know if anybody cares about him enough to warrant keeping both kinds of verifiers (we probably do not want to keep the signmessage part).\r\n\r\n> Just on this branch, I also created a 2-of-3 P2WSH address using addmultisigaddress and then attempted to signmessage with it. I received the error, ScriptPubKey does not refer to a key. Unless I'm misunderstanding BIP322, this should be possible and it would be cool if the wallet knew how to do it (however, even if the wallet doesn't know how to do it, as long as it's possible by BIP322, the error message should be changed). I didn't test any more advanced scripts, although I think that would be worthwhile to test later---in theory, the wallet should be able to signmessage for any script where its solver could sign for a spend. I think importing some advanced scripts using descriptors and then signmessage'ing for them might make a good addition to the integration tests in this PR.\r\n\r\nYes, BIP322 literally just says \"the sighash (normally based on the transaction) is X; now sign/verify with this address\" and uses exactly the same code that is used by the wallet to sign transactions, so anything goes. I'm actually confused why your example doesn't work out of the box. I'll look into that.\r\n\r\n> Another concern is that I don't believe the discussion over how BIP322 should handle timelocking opcodes (CLTV and CSV) was ever resolved. I think that's probably important before this could be released.\r\n\r\nActually, those should just be removed; they were meant for the proof of funds, which I am removing from BIP322. Thanks for the nudge.\r\n\r\n> Finally, I skimmed the code and left one documentation-related note. Thanks for working on this!\r\n\r\nGreat! Thanks, will address.",

Proving that you own an address is something that you do \"now\", not something you do and keep the proof around indefinitely. [...]\r\n\r\nI think there are several points here:\r\n\r\n1. This change breaks backwards compatibility between different versions of Bitcoin Core.  I think it's unfortunate if someone running version x can't create or verify proofs when talking to someone running version y.  Sure, it'd be nice if everyone upgraded to the latest version, but that takes time (sometimes years in the case of cold wallets).\r\n\r\n2. This change breaks compatibility with almost every other wallet that has implemented signmessage support.  Again, it'd be great if they all have BIP322 support ready at the same time this code gets into a Bitcoin Core release, but that seems extremely unlikely to me---I expect it to take years to get widespread BIP322 support.  Then each of those wallets has their own user upgrade cycle which may take years, so we're talking years + years until everyone is using BIP322 (if it is generally adopted at all).  Until near-universal adoption happens, it'd be nice if Bitcion Core is compatible with other wallets.\r\n\r\n3. As you mention, this breaks old signmessages.  While I don't feel strongly about that and I'm at least somewhat sympathetic with your arguments about people just generating new proofs, I think unnecessary breakage is something we should try to avoid.\r\n\r\nI think the appropriate solution to all three issues is that these existing RPCs should continue to generate and verify legacy P2PKH signmessages when called with P2PKH addresses.  They could automatically switch between legacy support and BIP322 support depending on address type or BIP322 could get new RPCs.  (Something to consider would be amending BIP322 so that P2PKH addresses in BIP322 are special cased to use the old signmessage format; that way this PR can be made fully BIP322 compliant and yet backward compatible.)",

    "body": "Thanks for picking this up again.\n\nI don't think we should gratuitously break compatibility with the existing signature scheme; that's generally not the approach we take with RPCs, and given that the scheme is implemented in other software too probably even more disruptive.\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to adding an exception in BIP322 that for P2PKH address the existing key recovery based scheme is used; in general I like avoiding ambiguity in these things. However I also see this may add additional complication to the spec, and perhaps not be very clear cut either (why just the P2PKH ones, and not the extensions to other single-key address types people have proposed and adopted in other software, for example?).",

You may want to consider making `signmessagewithprivkey` default to using P2PKH for backwards compatibility and add a third argument to that RPC that allows selecting P2WPKH (I'd suggest the argument select between P2PKH and P2WPKH (rather than legacy vs bip322) so that it can be extended to take a P2TR argument or other address format argument in the future).\r\n\r\nI skimmed [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/cfcd4e1a37545a8c86ab22e1cda540e876f11836) with the proposed changes to BIP322 and left a couple nits.  As a specification, I think it could also use a description of `CKey::SignCompact()` and `CKey::RecoverCompact()` such as how they serialize which derived pubkey to use and whether or not it's compressed or uncompressed.  An alternative to putting this information in BIP322 would be to create a separate BIP for the established legacy signmessage format (which was created before we had BIPs) and then simply have BIP322 reference that BIP.  I can help with documentation if you'd like.",

I think this is related to @luke-jr's comments.  \r\n\r\nOn a more technical level and related to the previous point: Does the BIP implicitly assume that a scriptPubKey contains exactly one pubkey? I'm not sure after reading it. Signing seems to fail if I can't derive a private key from a scriptPubKey (but this could happen because there is not a single pubkey in the scriptPubKey OR because we don't have the private key). Verification always uses some sighash, but what if there is no pubkey (or more than one pubkey)? This illustrates what I meant when I said the purposes are different: If you want to verify a signed message, you need a pubkey (and better exactly one). If you want to prove ownership, we shouldn't give the user a `verifymessage` function that in fact won't verify a signature in some cases.\r\n\r\nI guess I have some more comments but it's probably better to clarify this first.

New address formats and such will work out of the box assuming the underlying node(s) actually understand them.\r\n\r\nOkay, I see. This was not clear at all the me from reading the BIP because the BIP talks about verifying messages based on the \"Bitcoin Script Format\". (Yes, it's kind of clear if you look at the RPC...) But the purpose of the BIP is rather signing and verifying messages with respect to address (and the script format is only a technical tool.) I think this can be made clearer in the BIP.\r\n\r\n> Aside from the fact it is extensible to add another purpose (for the reason stated above), I'm not sure it's overly middle-groundy as it stands. What could be trimmed out to make it less so without burning too many bridges in a potential future expansion to add a POF purpose?\r\n\r\nHm yeah, good question. I think @luke-jr is right and we don't need multiple proofs for simple signatures of messages. And we should think about disallowing proofs that don't require any signatures.\r\n\r\nAlso the terminology is somehow unclear, both in the BIP and in the code. What I mean is that don't understand the difference between a \"proof\" and a \"signature\" (or maybe call it \"message signature\" or \"signed message\" to make clear it's not a signature of a transaction)?\r\n\r\nIf I read the code correctly, the basic idea is \r\n * checking that a provided script matches the address and\r\n * verifying the script but replacing every signature verification operation by a signature verification operation on the provided message instead of the transaction.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this was only clear to me after reading the code and not at all from the BIP.\r\n\r\nAnother concern that I have is that there are a lot of verification result codes (related to what I said above for ERROR/INVALID). I guess we INCOMPLETE for PSBT? But this should concern signers only. Wouldn't INVALID be enough for a verifier?\r\n\r\nAlso, I see the point of INCONCLUSIVE but this reminds me a lot of certificate warnings, which are a UX mess. What should I as a user when I get an inconclusive signature? (I'm not saying that I have a better idea to implement this.)",

[...] Does the BIP implicitly assume that a scriptPubKey contains exactly one pubkey?\r\n\r\nI think this isn't the best way to think about this facility.   Bitcoin transactions are not signed with ECDSA.  They are signed with a digital signature system called \"Bitcoin Script\".  Bitcoin Script happens to have ECDSA embedded in it-- like ECDSA has field multiplication embedded in it.  A bitcoin message signing thing can be seen as just a sign-stuff-using-script.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is complicated by the fact that script itself is expected to be embedded in a consensus system, so stuff like softforks are awkward to handle.\r\n\r\nWhy would someone want to sign messages using script?  In practice usually for dumb reasons for proving control or tying metadata to addresses that used to control funds, currently currently control funds, or will control funds in the future.  For these latter three things, nothing less than Bitcoin Script would work-- no amount of \"sniff scripts yank keys out\" would actually get the right behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor the \"currently control funds\" case it would be very useful if the system actually can check the existence of the funds (e.g. specifying txouts and checking them). For the \"previously controlled funds\" it would be very useful if the system could check that (SPV proofs for the outputs? kinda big :( ).\r\n\r\nBut for the \"will control funds in the future\" case there is basically no special behaviour needed/possible except signing with the same digital signature system which will eventually be used.\r\n\r\nSo I think this would mostly be useful for this last case. But that last case might better by serve by dry-signing an actual transaction with a dummy input/locktime, since doing that actually verifies your ability to sign for transaction like things.\r\n\r\nFor CSV, CLTV... probably the right way to do that is have them go in as non-locked (max sequence) by default but allow specifying other values for these fields as some kind of argument tagged onto the end of the address.",

The question you quoted was at a time when I really didn't understand what was going on in the BIP.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe one point where my crypto heart hurts is when you call this a signature scheme. That's just because I have a different defintion in mind. Let's say script is a scheme for authorizing transactions. \r\n \r\nBut this is one of the open points here: We need to think about the terminology:\r\nI think \"signed message\" is misleading given how expressive scripts are: If you know about  cryptography, you think of a signature scheme. But this really breaks down when it comes to, e.g., anyonecanspend or hash preimages, where ECDSA is not involved. If you have no idea of cryptographic definitions, a \"signed message\" should still be something that only someone with a secret can produce and that cannot by modified by someone without the secret. Again, this intuition breaks down with unusual scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of \"control\"? This comes with a sound of \"I'm the only one in control\" and is again strange for anyonecanspend. \r\n\r\nMaybe something that means \"proof that you can fulfill the script\" but with nicer words? \r\n\r\nSorry, I'm not really constructive here but I don't have a better suggestion at the moment.\r\n\r\n> Apologies about lack of activity.

    "body": "FWIW, I think it would be better to add an `interfaces::Wallet::signMessage()` method instead of adding an `interfaces::Wallet::getSigningProvider()` method. Few reasons:\r\n\r\n1) It would allow deduplicating more code for signing messages instead of having it written twice in qt and rpcwallet.\r\n\r\n2) It would create a little less work for me with #10102, so I don't have to an add IPC wrapper around `SigningProvider`, or serialize `SigningProvider` with private key information and send it from the wallet process to the qt process.\r\n\r\n3) Just in general I think `rpcwallet.cpp` is too monolothic and has too much important code mixed with UniValue boilerplate. So I'd love to see something like `src/wallet/sign.h` / `src/wallet/sign.cpp` files with a `bool SignMessage(CWallet& wallet, message, options...)` function and start organizing things better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm fine with this approach, but wanted to suggest an alternative.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed `Wallet&` to `CWallet&` above (sorry for the confusing typo) ",

It seems like it only has access to `CWallet` (while the QT side only has access to `interfaces::Wallet`).\r\n\r\nIs the idea to add two signmessage functions, where the interface one simply calls down into `m_wallet->SignMessage(..)`?",

    "body": "> @ryanofsky That sounds good to me! I am not sure how to access the `interfaces::Wallet` instance from `rpcwallet.cpp` though. It seems like it only has access to `CWallet` (while the QT side only has access to `interfaces::Wallet`).\r\n\r\nrpcwallet.cpp shouldn't need to access `interfaces::Wallet` here (and in general) because `interfaces::Wallet` doesn't contain any real functionality, it's just a high level wrapper around selected wallet functions that GUI code uses to indirectly control wallets.\r\n\r\nSo the idea is just to implement a standalone function in wallet code:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool SignMessage(CWallet& wallet, message, options...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand to call this function both from `wallet/rpcwallet.cpp` and `interfaces/wallet.cpp` (just adding a one-line `WalletImpl::signMessage()` wrapper method in the interface code).\r\n\r\n> Is the idea to add two signmessage functions, where the interface one simply calls down into `m_wallet->SignMessage(..)`?\r\n\r\nSorry! Just realized I had a typo in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16440#discussion_r308805714, which is fixed now but was probably pretty confusing. I was trying to suggest not having a `CWallet::SignMesage(...)` method, but instead defining a standalone `SignMessage(CWallet&, ...)` function. Really either a method or a standalone function would be fine, but the function seemed better because we're gradually breaking CWallet up and pulling functionality out of it, so adding new functionality there without a reason seemed to be moving in wrong direction.",

I think it's cleaner to use `ERROR` only for real processing errors when we can't reach a result, e.g., out-of-memory (okay, maybe a bad example here). Here, we have a result: The proof is invalid because a legacy proof for P2PKH is not allowed.\r\n\r\nThe background is that crypto APIs typically work like this and are easier to get wrong for the user. If someone gives me a 3 byte string and claims it's an ECDSA signature for some message and some key, then it's an invalid signature. That's all I care about if I call a RPC, I don't care (or shouldn't care) why it's invalid and I don't need to handle different errors differently.",

An error in this case means the proof could not be deserialized. Saying it's invalid means the user will not even know that the proof wasn't checked at all, which would be useful for debugging the reason. (For example, if someone provides a proof from Electrum (IIRC) which uses the legacy mode for new address types, it should error, not say invalid, because those proofs are not properly formatted according to BIP-322.)",

(Note that the proof is attacker-provided. It's not an \"uncommon\" event to get a totally malformed proof.) Having different codes that are all invalid opens up the possibility for subtle bugs in handling those e.g., exception thrown for error and return value for `INVALID`, which leads to different behavior in the end.\r\n * For the user: I think the user should not be concerned with debugging information. Also, the error code will not be essentially here, the user can always show the (invalid) proof.",
