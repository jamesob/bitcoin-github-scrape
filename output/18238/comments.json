It took about 12 minutes for all 99k transactions to get requested/notfound by all 11 peers, so 19 seconds total doesn't seem too bad. (The check for MAX_PEER_TX_IN_FLIGHT significantly cuts down on whether this actually does anything -- if there's lots of tx's announced by each peer, then most of them will always have most tx's in flight)",

    "body": "@naumenkogs Yeah; in a worst case scenario you could get 100 txids in a NOTFOUND message, have 125 peers to cycle through, and each peer could have announced 100k txs, so you end up with something like `O( 12,500 * log(100000) )` operations as a result of a single message (albeit with a fair chunk of setup). The test indicates that 11 peers on my hardware gives a time of about 20us per txid, so per NOTFOUND with 110 peers (so a factor of 100*10) that might result in 20ms processing time on a single message. That seemed low enough to be worth a PR to me.\r\n\r\nIf that's not good enough, could make it a bit lower in the worst case fairly easily by not retrying NOTFOUNDs as aggressively (eg, only do it for the first 10 txids in a NOTFOUND message, or ban peers if they often report a txid as NOTFOUND despite having INVed it recently, or change the retry delay from 0s-2s to 2s-4s, etc); but it'd need more rework of the data structures to get it to work efficiently, and then you have to ensure the new data structures don't introduce different DoS possibilities.",
