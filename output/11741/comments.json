The log is just a text file, it needs to claim no environment, and a directory is not a good abstraction for it. If someone wants bitcoin to log to an existing directory with other log files e.g. `/var/log/bitcoinlog` that should be possible. The only requirement is write access.\r\n\r\n> so that parts of the process could be sandboxed on Linux using seccomp().\r\n\r\nFWIW in my experiments with running bitcoin with CloudABI I've used `-printtoconsole` to log to a stream instead. This is much easier in restricted environments, and the stream can be processed and stored anywhere desired by an external process. I usually recommend that for more advanced logging setups.\r\n\r\n> Do you think it's possible there would be other log files in the future? \r\n\r\nPossible - maybe an auditing / RPC log instead of a debug log. However there is no reason it'd need to be in the same directory, this could have a new option to place it.\r\n\r\n> There appears to be a db.log file that is used for wallets, but I didn't update that code path. It would be a minor change to update that as well.\r\n\r\ndb.log belongs with the wallet directory, no need to touch it here.\r\n",

    "body": "> @laanwj what do you mean? Currently there is debug.log, testnet3/debug.log and regtest/debug.log.\r\n\r\nYes, the regtest/testnet edge case again. It really sucks that we have these configuration options shared between networks.\r\nIt's not clear that users even want that layout when they manually specify the logfile! A similar issue to #11726.\r\nIf we can get per-network configuration in (e.g. #10996) then most of this nonsense will go away.",

(or logdir in bitcoin.conf is an error/ignored)\r\n * -logdir only has an effect on mainnet, you have to use -regtest-logdir or -testnet-logdir or similar to have debug.log go elsewhere\r\n\r\nI think the last one seems like it might be the least surprising behaviour?
