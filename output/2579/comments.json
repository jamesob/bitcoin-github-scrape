    "body": "technical:\n\nIterating through the block would only give me txids of all transactions within a block. With IsMine() I could check if this transaction belongs to my addresses. Then, I would have to to query the wallet to give me all transaction details for every transaction which is mine in the block I currently processed.\n\nI'm not sure if this would be more efficient because I thought json-rpc-calls are more expensive. So I thought, one single RPC-call would be better than lots of them ...\n\nnon-technical:\n\nI tried to find a method for reliably receive confirmations about sent and received payments. I wanted to process every block exactly once and I'm working with a database which supports transactions, so everything happens within a single sql-transaction.\n\nMy solution is absolutely bullet-proof and repeatable in case an Exception in my java code occures. So I don't lose/oversee anything and I can easily debug my errors.\n\nI invested almost a week and tried almost everything until I implemented it this way.\n\nThere is another method which is called 'listtransationssinceblock' but it mostly gives unconfirmed transactions over and over again (with each call) back to my java-class. I was not interested in unconfirmed transactions but the method couldn't be restricted to only give back confirmed txs.\n\nI also tried what you suggested but there was the issue with lots and lots of rpc queries ...\n",

If you are having problems with lots of RPC queries, then send a batch of them together as a JSON-RPC 2.0 batch.\n\nThe problem with this method is that it causes over-reliance on a broken assumption that block == totally confirmed transactions.  This is not true.  You might have a chain reorganization at any time, which would invalidate any queries based on a specific block height/hash, and move transactions from one block to another.\n",
