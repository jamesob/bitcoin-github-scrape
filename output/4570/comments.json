It pays as much as either one alone, but is not innocuous because it can stop both of them from confirming.  What the UI currently does is highlight both tx1-1 and tx1-2 (conflict seen).  tx2 is displayed (only because it pays us), and is also highlighted because it is a non-clone conflict.\n\nRe: GreenAddress can you connect the dots for me?  How does the script getting more permissive imply it's not important to alert if the coin is spent twice?\n",

    "body": "Lately, miners are pretty consistently [not mining respends](http://respends.thinlink.com/) if they occur quickly, apparently up to a day or so after the first spend.\n\nThat is nice, but the network still buries respends.

Then, at a succession of time offsets, he transmits a respend of each coin to the target.\n\nThe goal is for at least one tx2 to be seen by the _target first_, but the eventual _miner second_.  An additional constant input c0 is included in all the tx2 to ensure that in an adverse scenario for attacker, the target can only be paid once at most.

Target would be alerted almost immediately to withhold goods or services.\n\nIn addition to tuning the parameters, the attacker can use diverse nodes to gain variability in the timings, helping at least one pair to achieve the goal.\n",

    "body": "Some serious problems with this still: respend checking is performed after IsStandard , so a fraudster need only craft his transactions carefully to defeat this entirely; if the order of this is inverted, you then create a situation where it encourages people who want to send real non-IsStandard transactions to do so as a double spend. I think the only way to resolve this is to remove IsStandard from the policy entirely (and hope enough nodes continue to run with this policy). This is potentially very dangerous.\n\nFurthermore, it appears an attacker can flood the network with double-spends in order to rate limit relaying of some of them. I also see no efforts made to consider the relay costs: since these are double spends, only one or the other will confirm, and thus the fee from the non-confirming one is never paid.\n",

You're right, it's best to stick to the facts.\n\nYou are also correct that this change does not secure unconfirmed spends, and as currently written,  does not help in the construction of a system that does.\n\nWhat this change claims to do, and does, is to stop delaying the moment when interested parties can discover relayable double-spends.  The wallet portion also serves the important function of notifying the user of _successful_ double-spends.\n\nEven people with diametrically opposite views on whether unconfirmed transactions can ever gain more reliability agree that relaying double-spends, when possible, is an improvement.  The reason is that they happened, and that is useful information.\n",
