If I'm outnumbered on this, then I'll at least ask if we could drop the 'SIGHASH_' prefix on this; having the full string is kinda long if it's not meant to be parsed by anyone other than humans.\n",

I was back and forth on that before I pushed it up, so I'm happy for your opinions.\n\nI can see @petertodd's concern about this being a breaking change for people scripted against it. It's something to weigh. I don't know that adding more flags is the answer. From working on another pull request, my understanding is that the JSON is equivalent to \"verbose\".\n\nFWIW, I kind of like the extra decoding output myself because it's one less thing I have to think about. It's a simple decode like @petertodd said, but having it just there in plain sight means I don't have to remember, or go look it up.\n\nI will add some release notes comments in doc/release-notes.md in a little bit after waiting to hear what other feedback is.\n",

I would have normally assumed some annotation on the asm output, or an additional lower level asm view.\n\nMy goal was mostly that it would be clearly indicated in some manner stronger than squnting at bytes. In particular, squinting fails when you only barely know there is something you need to squint at. An expliact flag list would be much more obvious and discoverable.\n\nWRT compatiblity of the ASM output, we've certantly never promised to hold that encoding constant... it's fine if things are reading it, but they'll need to be revised if it changes.\n",

Also, if changing stuff like that _doesn't_ break any tests, keep in mind it's a sign that maybe depending on the exact format of the asm output is a bad idea. :)\n\n(yeah, the more I think about this, the more I think my original objection was wrong...)\n",

    "body": "> It is in script/interpreter, so it's already part of libconsensus, see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.am#L365\n\nThat's true. I was just thinking that determining whether a signature is validly encoded is generic enough that it could be useful without including the interpreter. Personal preference, I guess.\n\n> The sighash types and CheckSignatureEncoding are definitely part of consensus (and are used by the interpreter), please, just leave them there.\n\nI was assuming that to begin with, but IsDefinedHashtypeSignature is only called when the flags include SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC. The comment for SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC even states, \"not used or intended as a consensus rule\". The best I found was that scripts with a bad sighash type would fail to eval (and thus be non-standard), but that if they got into valid blocks we'd still have to accept those blocks. I suppose I could try it and see, but that's what made me say that the sig hash type is not actually part of consensus. Maybe we're using the word consensus in two different ways here.\n\n> The only thing you need to move is the new code for converting to string to script/standard and I think all layering concerns are gone.\n\nOh, you mean move ValueString and mapSigHashTypes over to script/standard and add the CScript as an argument to ValueString? Yes, that may make sense. And, if we move the sighash stuff from interpreter over to standard, then it'll all be in the same place.\n",

That way you will be able to pass only a const CScript& as parameter (no additional vch param, which is nice) and you will be making libconsensus actually smaller instead of bigger. \nI'm not sure how many places CScript::ToString is called, but it is just a mechanical replace for ToString(const CScript&) [or whatever you want to call it].\n\nSorry if I haven't clearer earlier about CScript::ToString: if you want to use the new function in script/standard, it cannot be a method of CScript but an independent function instead (because script/script should not depend on neither script/interpreter nor script/standard).\n",

    "body": "To try to be clearer: if you need to \"de-encapsulate\" anything from CScript - by creating a new child class that uses the protected arguments, by creating new getters or even by making a private/protected public - to be able to move CScript::ToString up, I'm totally fine with that.\nI'm happy with any solution that ends up with equal or less code in libconsensus (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.am#L365), anything else is secondary to me with rewards to this PR (it also makes it \"less risky\" [I don't think your changes are risky even violating the layering]).\nMy preference would be to simply rename `CScript::ToString()` to `script/standard::ToString(const CScript&)` - a trivial change using regular expressions or patience (the compiler won't let you get this little step wrong, anyway: just remove CScript::ToString and make the compiler happy with the new function). But better is better, so my only requirement for an utACK is what I said before: equal or less code in libconsensus (and less is better).\n\nEDIT: So, to be completely clear. It's not your fault that CScript::ToString() is in libconsensus, we just don't want you to make it worse by improving the method/function in-place.\n",

I took that and actually refactored these changes twice.\n\nI put each of the two ways into the last two commits.\n\nThe first commit refactored into a couple of formatter classes. It worked, but the second/next idea seemed a little cleaner.\n\nThe second commit does away with the formatter class idea of the previous commit and just moves CScript::ToString out into a function in core_write.cpp.\n\nI think this last commit converges your input with sipa's input. I think the last one loops in everyone's input, doesn't layer violate, and reduces code from the consensus library.\n\nI purposefully didn't choose to sighhash decode some scriptSigs that were just going to be logged since those usages were tangential to what i was trying to actually update for this ticket.\n\nLet me know what you think of the latest.

    "body": "You are welcomed. I'm fine with putting new things in core_io as @sipa suggested, just not in libconsensus. `CTransaction::ToString` now calls `ScriptToAsmStr` so instead of putting script/standard in libconsensus, now you're putting core_io instead. The important thing is this: independently of where you chose to put the new code outside of libconsensus, you cannot include that new code from libconsensus. That's why I keep posting a link to the list of files that are part of libconsensus: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.am#L365\nIf you include more things in any of those files, travis will complain (unless you adapt the makefile properly to include the new file, in which case we will complain).\n\nSo, either don't adapt CTransaction::ToScript to the new code (seems the simpler solution) or also take CTransaction::ToString out of consensus (seems better but also more work). \n",
