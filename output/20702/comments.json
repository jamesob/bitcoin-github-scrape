    "body": "Perhaps there are ways to mitigate this issue? I could see two situations in which block data move around:\r\n\r\n* arbitrarily during run time - this seems incredibly unlikely outside of reorgs (reindexing needs to be done in case of reorgs anyway)\r\n* on upgrade - upgrade may take longer time because of this; similar things already happened to indexes\r\n\r\nA simple way to deal with these is to have some kind of \"block layout version\" that can be obtained over RPC. If the layout is ever changed, the version is bumped and indexers will need to reindex. As described above, this is most likely in case of a long upgrade needs to be done anyway, so it wouldn't be too annoying.\r\n\r\nTo make it a bit more future-proof we could have two version numbers: one for the format of blocks already on disk, another for format in general. If bitcoind is updated, the existing blocks are not changed, but future blocks may have some differences then the former version number doesn't change the latter does - avoids reindex when not actually needed and also avoids indexers that don't support a new version blindly attempting to process a layout they don't understand.\r\n\r\nI believe it'd be best to introduce this versioning right from the start. (Just return constant zeroes for now.)\r\n\r\nIf it ever happens that a single block (or a few blocks) is moved around, then doing full reindexing would be inefficient but I assume it'd be sensible to not try to solve it right now. That means let's not do something excessive like adding a layout version to each block now.",

The Bitcoin Core wallet must keep the wallet's public keys unencrypted in order to track them, meaning that a compromise of the node is a complete compromise of the wallet privacy.\r\n\r\nI don't actually follow the exact use case here. But it looks like you want to reduce the wallet-privacy-exposure time (the time publickeys/scripts are exposed to the memory). Which I think is a valid point. Though indexing \"all\" addresses for this seems an inefficient trade-off.\r\n\r\nOne seeking limited exposure time for their public-keys/scripts could and maybe should use blockfiters. It seems much better to scale and the filters are of value for the entire network.\r\n\r\n**Just scan the filters (timespan from `last-wallet-sync` to `now`) and scan the relevant blocks. Should be fairly quick for a couple of days or weeks (seconds).**\r\n\r\nIn general, I discourage building full indexes for personal wallet backends. It is not efficient IMO and leads to development focus on the wrong end.\r\n\r\nA full address index can be of value for pure exploring, inspecting, developing, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcept ~0 on this.",

It could be deployed for local blockfiles at the cost of adding a to the places where the block is serialized/deserialized on disk and would reduce node storage for the blockchain currently by about 74GB in exchange for making operations which read blocks more cpu intense.  I'd personally have one more unpruned full node running at least for another year, with such a change. \r\n\r\n(I cite that code because its existing and not hypothetical-- it isn't even the limit of what could be done, but just a concrete example that requires very little change to the surrounding codebase, and could also be extended to reduce P2P bandwidth by a similar amount  (at least after erlay gets rid of most of the rumouring overhead)).\r\n\r\nIf you have to make a round trip request to the RPC to get the location is actually fetching the block itself over the RPC that much worse?  I would assume most of the cost is in the request roundtrip and for similar cost you could request the block and index it and maintain an index from address (or whatever) to block number/hash.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@Kixunil   Lets imagine that we knew the next major version would add block compression (it certainly could, it's been written after all).  If that happened then every user of this interface would be broken by the change, and couldn't move forward without either radically changing what it was doing or adopting complex core specific code to decode the blocks.  So then compatibility becomes an impediment to implementing compression and improving it in subsequent versions.\r\n\r\nIf it were decided that it was okay to adopt this interface with no promise of compatibility in the future-- with an answer of \"tough luck\" should other improvements make it incompatible,  then what is the need to upstream a patch to add this interface?   Anyone who wanted it could apply it locally.  It would be an unsupported interface, but I think that is exactly what any interface where there isn't an intention to preserve it is just that-- an unsupported interface.\r\n\r\n >  Bitcoind changed its API in breaking way many times and it seems nobody cared.\r\n\r\nMany people have cared very much, and created ecosystem problems by delaying/avoiding upgrading because of a compatibility breaking change.  And this is with an API that mostly only exposed things whos functionality could be preserved if only with some minor renaming.\r\n\r\nThere is a big difference between a break where you have to change from reading in one place to reading in two others -- just a few minutes work and a minor change to the caller -- compared to a change where the equivalent functionality is just completely gone without any ready alternative.  I could cite an example where bitcoind interface changed in a way where the functionality was just gone with no ready drop in alternative, but that has been extremely rare (and the only example I can think of off the top of my head is where the removed functionality was basically broken).\r\n",

    "body": "Speaking as an external wallet developer, I hope to provide some context that may be useful. One of the original goals of my project was to provide an application that took full advantage of a local copy of the blockchain, providing enough functionality to convince people to run their own node, and thus increasing the number of nodes and improving the bitcoin network generally. To name some of these features: Quick loading of any wallet, blockchain exploration, transaction history analysis, and the privacy aspect I mentioned above. As we see from the timing results, some of these are not practical without access to the full ledger, with the addition of an address-based index.\r\n\r\nThe reality is however that it is quite resource intensive to maintain such an index - for example runnning ElectrumX requires an SSD and long initial processing, resulting in a 60GB mainnet index replicating much blockchain data, and requiring further processing to maintain. Few users have the capacity for such an undertaking. On the other hand, this proposal reduces required disk space, but more importantly indexing time, making it much more accessible particularly to pre-built node offerings.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the tradeoff to maintaining conservative and restricted access to confirmed blocks may be fewer full nodes, as projects which attempt to fully leverage a local ledger fail to get critical mass due to the high initial bar to gain relevant access to it.\r\n\r\n> couldn't move forward without ... adopting complex core specific code to decode the blocks\r\n\r\nIMO, there would certainly be considerable motivation to port such code - the value of direct access to the ledger is substantial.",

    "body": "@craigraw That's an interesting perspective I hadn't considered: that having access to an indexed blockchain means address/key/script information can be offline more of the time.\n\nI'm not sure there is much that can be done about that. I consider anything that needs fast access to the full blockchain (even absent any indexing) as inherently too resource intensive and unscalable already. It's not realistic to assume end users will want to dedicate the resources to operate that, and thus any infrastructure relying on that will inevitably end up with trusted third parties. Whether a copy of the chain is involved in doing so seems like a small (literally, 2) constant factor that at best kicks the can down the road for a few years. It doesn't even need to be a factor two; you can run Bitcoin Core in pruning mode, and an indexing service (which copies the full blocks into its database, in whatever form is most convenient to them) that does not prune on top.\n\nIMHO the most scalable approach is simply having local wallets (online, but possibly offline most of the time) that scan each block once (in full, or using filters) and remember transactions that matter to them. That doesn't need fast access (just streaming), and doesn't need indexing.\n\nThere are of course use cases for full indexing; debugging, certain large services, ... and we should enable them the best we can. But it feels hacky, and hard to maintain a stable interface, to try to do that using Bitcoin Core's own storage, which was never designed for this purpose, and will going forward have different priorities.",

People have the option to pirate digital content for free, yet many choose to spend money instead. The best theory explaining it so far is convenience. If this applies more widely, if having chain indexed has significantly better UX, then I expect at least some people paying for it.\r\n\r\n> IMHO the most scalable approach is simply having local wallets (online, but possibly offline most of the time) that scan each block once (in full, or using filters) and remember transactions that matter to them.

Perhaps there's a different way to do it that would be saner but I'm not convinced there's an obvious solution.\r\n\r\n Anyway, since @romanz agreed to look into other solutions, I'm not going to push this further. Just wanted to give an insight from my experience.\r\n",
