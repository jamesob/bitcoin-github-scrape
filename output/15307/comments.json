    "body": "Curious why this is marked WIP. Would be good to clarify if you are still working on changes or are presently seeking review.\r\n\r\n> Is there a reason why this duplicates the functionality rather than directly move it?\r\n\r\nI don't think it should hold up this PR, but I do have the same question, and personally would love to see a PR getting rid of the current duplication between [`CreateWallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d83d6079432cf592ff6c740d1d3fbdb5e596facb/src/wallet/wallettool.cpp#L24) and [`createwallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d83d6079432cf592ff6c740d1d3fbdb5e596facb/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L2579), [`LoadWallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d83d6079432cf592ff6c740d1d3fbdb5e596facb/src/wallet/wallettool.cpp#L51) and [`loadwallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d83d6079432cf592ff6c740d1d3fbdb5e596facb/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L2523).\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have a plan or at least a basic idea going forward of how to avoid duplicating functionality between the wallet and wallet tool. Making the wallet tool into a limited frontend for a subset RPC methods that work offline (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379) would be a good approach that would enable code sharing, and also decrease the likelihood of a garbagey command line parsing code getting added to wallet tool in the future. But other approaches are certainly possible.",
