    "body": "Sorry for this little change, but...\n\n@thuni was concerned about introducing globals in policy.h\nfIsBareMultisigStd can be easily turned into an attribute later as shown in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/policy_new...jtimon:policy_moveonly (in fact it could be done more easily not moving AreInputsStandard at the same time as IsStandardTx)\nBut minRelayTxFee is in many more places, and after proposing some changes to #5159, I am no longer convinced that I want to move things like IsDust to policy directly. One possibility would be to put all the fee policy stuff in the estimator. Then an interface of the estimator can be returned by CPolicy, for example, making a CPolicy::GetFeePolicy() analogous to CChainParams::GetConsensus().\nThe minimum fee can still be configured from the constructor of CStandardPolicy but it can pass it directly to the estimator without storing it redundantly.\nIn that case some files could be dependent on policy/fees but not in policy/policy (just like some functions depend on Consensus::Params but not on CChainParams), then some of the 5 includes I just removed would have to be changed for policy/fees later.\n\nFor all these reasons I'm keeping minRelayTxFee in main for now.\n\nMoving minRelayTxFee to policy/policy could still prevent it from depending on main temporarily when IsStandardTx is moveonly, but it doesn't seem to be worth it.\n",

    "body": "@dgenr8 Non-centralisation. Authority to decide policy lies with the node operators and miners, and it's not a responsibility/power developers should have. Too much policy monoculture also creates incentives to use bad practices (trusting unconfirmed transactions) and make trouble for the outliers. Also, since the current policy monoculture is mostly _reference_ policy, it also causes spam problems since there are no effective reference-suitable spam filters; and this is in partly out of necessity due to policy being intimately mixed in with the reference codebase.\n",

    "body": "I think there are different issues here.\n\nOne is that this is a step towards separating out policy code from consensus code. This PR is part of that. Eventually, we should end up with a situation where consensus is clearly separated in the source code (so we know when to be extremely careful in review and tests when someone wants to change it), and likewise have policy separated out (so people changing/forking the code know what can be safely changed).\n\nAnd yes, I think that the ability to change policy is essential, for the reasons that @luke-jr brings up. For one, relay (and other) policy is constantly changing anyway (pretty much every Bitcoin Core release has changed what is being relayed). You should not rely on it being uniform on the network.\n\nOf course, I think that we, as maintainers of a particular piece of Bitcoin network software, have a responsibility to make the code do what we think is best for the network - and possibly expose only part of the involved parameters to users. But that doesn't mean that others can't disagree. And separating out policy code makes it explicit exactly which part of the code is a choice.\n",

    "body": "> Could you outline the plan for next steps after this goes in?\n\nReopened #5180 as one of the things that I consider an important next step (although @luke-jr wasn't very happy with it the first time I proposed it). Other \"next steps\" (like #5114 ) are related to fees.\n\n> Standard flags/values are still hard-coded in several places, so I'm not sure that exposing the \"-policy\" option makes sense until it's possible to actually run with a different policy.\n\nWell, it will take some time until all standard flags/values are encapsulated here (specially if we never take a first step), and some things will be harder to discuss than others.\nBut I think the option is useful already. Advanced users (say, miners) can trivially implement their own CCustomPolicy and select it with the option (-policy=custom) without breaking any tests or risking consensus.\nAs we encapsulate more policy code in CStandardPolicy, the option will become more useful as the custom policy can modify more things.\nI could always leave the -policy option for #5180 but as said I think it's already useful to make it easy for the advanced user to implement and select their own policy.\n",

Advanced users (say, miners) can trivially ...\n\nThinking more about this...if we're assuming advanced users and they want to preserve the standard policy in their build and not simply replace it, they can also trivially add the new option themselves, so there's no reason to expose the new option until it has any use.\nSo I starded reducing the scope of this PR.\n\nSince I was touching the initialization parts, I also realized that @theuni was probably more concerned about was introducing globals in policy.cpp, something we're trying to fix for chainparams.\nI previously said to @luke-jr that we shouldn't rely on a policy global, but a global-returning-pseudo-factory function doesn't solve that: only passing CPolicy as parameter to the functions that depend on it will solve that.\nMy concern with luke's approach wasn't with the global itself, but with the fact that he was exposing and using a different for CStandardPolicy than for CPolicy. By hidding CStandardPolicy I'm sure I'm respecting advanced users and I'm happy to remove any additions to the \"first step\" (there were previous \"first steps\" before this \"first step\").\nActions:\n- Remove all globals from policy.cpp and the new -policy option, hopefully pleasing @theuni \n- Restore the simple global in main.cpp for the policy, just this time is compatible with CStandardPolicy being hidden by using a Factory. Hopefully this will please @luke-jr .\n\nI think #5180 is a perfect example for motivating this PR. Even if it's not accepted by itself, it's a simple example of how an advanced user could write his own custom policy (although removing that CChainParams dependecy from AcceptToMemoryPool should even be nicer for an example).\n",

    "body": "After a talk with @luke-jr on IRC, I think I understand his vision better. The \"having a class named CStandardPolicy is a bug, because there shouldn't be any standard policy\" part is not clear to me yet though. If we want to make it simple for coders to implement and maintain custom policies (why would we have an interface and an implementation class otherwise?), then we need a name for the class implementing the interface. \nHe doesn't oppose to a -policy option either: he just wants to use \"-acceptnonstdtxn\" instead of \"-policy=test\". Which is fine. I can always create a PR with \"-policy=example_custom\" or something (although \"-policy=test\" decouples policy/policy from chainparams, but let's leave that for later).\n\nAbout the prohibition of  \"-acceptnonstdtxn=0 -testnet=0 -regtest=0\", he doesn't cares, but he feared that #6329 would be rejected otherwise. As discussed with @petertodd  in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6329#discussion_r33987204 , I really believe that the whole point of exposing policy options is to allow users to select them, and I don't think we want to maintain the ugly initialization complexity burden of knowing which policy options are prohibited for each particular chain.\nThat's why I added f2e8fbd1 at the end, but if we can't arrive to a conclusion on this fast I will leave it for later instead of squashing it. 5c9c0bfc may seem bikeshedding but it's just taking the fest opportunity to fix a little mistake in #6329.\nI'll wait for review before squashing or discarding the fixup commits.\n",

This improvement doesn't make the PR less mergeable or reviewable, and since no acks/nacks where received since a minimized the scope I thought it was a no brainer to include it.\n\nNow I'm 99% that further non-bike-shedding (and I already s/Validate/Approve) nits are possible at all.\n\nThe biggest subset of what has been moved out is still being kept rebased in #6423 (including CPolicy::GetOptionsHelp() which will supposedly help @luke-jr create qt forms for configuring these options dynamically [when you show me how to do that I will want to do the same for all the options, not just the policy ones]), but it will be closed (for depending on this one) as soon as I know what travis thinks about it and until this is merged.\n",

We don't need to wait for having attributes (#6423) to separate the interface CPolicy from the reference implementation CStandardPolicy (but I wanted to leave that out because @luke-jr seems to have a problem with using the term \"standard\" in the reference implementation [I'm happy to paint it CReferencePolicy if that helps]).\nNow I'm looking at that private method in CPolicy and thinking that a purely-interface class like CPolicy is intended to be should never have private methods, call me purist if you want.\nBy no means I want to delay this (I have plenty of code waiting for this [or that could become cleaner after this]), but if it's not going to do it, I would be happy to squash the latest fixup commit  I added (note that the delta to the total diff count is really small [even moving some documentation from the cpp to the .h, my mistake for thinking that we didn't even wanted CStandardPolicy in policy.h, but hidden in the .cpp]). \nIf it's going to delay this, I'm happy leaving it for an independent PR, #6423 or just any other PR that depends on the separation, whatever is preferred.\n",

    "body": "For example, the current mempool code has a feerate index which the size limiting relies on for correctness. It doesn't require that the feerate exactly represents fee per byte, but it does represent an ordering that has to be respected. Policy can reasonably override what a transaction's \"fee\" means and what its \"size\" means, but can't bypass or change the need for such an index in the first place. So no, I think it's unreasonable to say that the mempool can't place any limitation of what the policy can do. Policy is inherently just something that plugs into the other code, and I don't think there can be any expectation of a stable API. If the mempool code changes, what can be configured in it can change too.\n",

    "body": "It seems we have different ideas of what the policy class will do, and I'm afraid we can only decide that in incremental changes. If I understood @luke-jr correctly, he is not going to utACK unless I rename some of the methods, for example s/AcceptTxInputs/AcceptTxInputs_Incomplete. He agrees that we can AcceptTxInputsV2, AcceptTxInputsV3, etc when/if we change the method (for example, to include fee validation), but he would prefer to \"not start counting until a reasonable baseline\" (although didn't provide a definition for what a \"reasonable baseline\" is). We will have to move on without his utACK because I think it is too late for bike-shedding and he already got me to s/Validate/Accept in all methods.\n\n@sipa It is true that we won't be able to finish the encapsulation while the mempool code is unstable, but we know that we want a policy interface and we know we want at least the code currently in policy/policy.cpp to be encapsulated behind this interface. We've known this for more than a year (and many more things like #5114 that are waiting for CPolicy to exist). This hardly conflicts with any of the work done in the mempool and if it does, it does it in a trivial-to-rebase way.\n\nIf it is decided to freeze policy encapsulation until \"the mempool code is stable\", fine. It is very frustrating to try to just with a simple class for policy encapsulation for more than one year (see #5071, #5180, #5595 among other related PRs...) with no success. In the meantime, my policy encapsulation research branches bitrot and I waste my time in the rebase mouse wheel. I could just stop wasting my time and stop any work on policy encapsulation (or at least, stop maintaining open PRs and start maintaining a per-major-release branch or something) until the \"right time\" arrives.\n\n@laanwj should I rebase before 0.12 or just close it instead?\n",

I had made this point originally in #5071 (2014 Oct) which you based your work on initially. Even on this thread, I left the comment to that effect Aug 28, two days after you submitted the PR. Also, understandable API interfaces is not bike-shedding. Finally, it is never too late to address things in an unmerged PR, much less to \"move on without...utACK\" simply because you don't want to address them.\n",

    "body": "You are right, it is never too late to change things. But I've tried my best to understand how renaming a method is not bike-shedding and how  AcceptTxInputs_Incomplete, AcceptTxInputs, AcceptTxInputsV2 is better than  AcceptTxInputs, AcceptTxInputsV2, AcceptTxInputsV3 without success. I've been reducing the scope of the policy PRs (and adapting them from yours and other people's feedback) since I started and now suddenly \"it is incomplete\". If we cannot do this work incrementally I'm out, because I already know that my multi-commit branches will be considered to hard to review. #5071 was also incomplete: we can't do this perfectly in a simple one commit PR, that's simply not possible. \nTake into account that I started implementing alternatives to #5071 because I didn't agree with everything that was there. Let's find out where we can agree easier first and then discuss the other more fundamental disagreements. But if our only disagreement and the only reason  why you don't utACK this is the name of a method, then I'm fine not having your utACK (which otherwise I find very interesting because I know you've worked on policy encapsulation as well). Of course, I'm assuming that you won't nack this for a method name either, and if you do I assume your nack can be ignored.\nNo, this is not will be a final API, this is a tiny first step that will need more steps after it. That doesn't mean any of the current method names are bad choices for the first version of the API.\n",
