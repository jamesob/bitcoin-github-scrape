    "body": "Thanks @fanquake, after adding the `ranlib` line I was able to build on macOS High Sierra (with Boost 1.64.0) by running:\r\n`make HOST=aarch64-linux-android ANDROID_API_LEVEL=29 ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/Users/igor/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/ NO_QT=1 NO_WALLET=1`\r\n\r\n@greenaddress I believe Google only mandates 64-bit in addition to 32-bit. Pure 64-bit native packages are fine. Going forward I don't personally see much demand for 32-bit since Android is moving to 64-bit so those devices are going to be increasingly rare and most likely underpowered.",

Even if the QT current GUI worked on android i would argue it wouldn't be very useful.\r\n\r\nI am aware of a QML PR but I imagine this PR needs to go first anyway and I'd like to think of this PR in the context of master.\r\n\r\nQt build support IMHO should come when there's something usable on android as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nAlso I think support for Android needs to be for all 4 currently supported targets (i686-linux-android, x86_64-linux-android, aarch64-linux-android and arm-linux-androideabi). As a note a lot of emulators images are i686. \r\n\r\nAndroid support should also be better than just android 29. I suggest android 19 as minimum for 32 bit and 21 as minimum for 64 bit (64 bit afaik was introduced at 21) or both android 21 should also be reasonable at this point (although declining, lose 6.9% of android market)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the libevent patch from bitcoin_ndk but it's actually to patch libevent code with code from a newer version of libevent - once core updates libevent it won't be necessary.",

I just checked on [geizhals.eu](https://geizhals.eu/?cat=umtsover&xf=148_Android#gh_filterbox) and out of 3186 Android phones out there only 2 run x86, that's 0.06% marketshare. 32-bit ARM is probably not going to run Core all that well. Android API 19 was released 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn my mind running Bitcoin Core is a flagship device game so that's what I focus on. But like I said  patches for supporting other arch or lower API levels are welcome. I'll even concede that x86_64 is useful because of the emulators.",

In as far as i can tell API level 24 is the earliest version that can compile core as is without modifications to core's code. \r\n\r\nWhile indeed android devices vary, flagship devices from 3-4 years ago, hardware which by today's standards is considered mid-range are perfectly capable of running it.

And on top of the previous points in favour of keeping the changes, i'd like to again point out that android is now by far the most dominant OS, and I strongly believe that our efforts to enable FULL support of it are on the right track.",

    "body": "@greenaddress during my attempts to produce and test an apk, at first it would not compile properly, then the apk would not start , then it would crash immediately after sync. A lot of the time (using gdb)  I kept getting traces to various aspects of threads and networking. Eventually after a lot of google searches and reading comments across github and stackoverflow, i used api 24 and I got a stable build without need to mod core. It is possible we could go lower, but i haven't tried. Another part of why i am fine with 24 is that according to the distro map on https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards , it covers ~60% of known active android devices and IMO devices running lower versions of android are also likely to be underpowered and will have difficulty running core.\r\n",

    "body": "When JVM loads a native lib (via [system.load](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System#load(java.lang.String))) it invokes its `JNI_OnLoad` function. Qt for Android uses this mechanism to do all kinds of init and register native functions for the Java side to use. The proper and supported way is to dynamically link and then each separate `libqt*.so` inits itself through `JNI_OnLoad` as it is loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever I wanted to link statically into one big blob so with this tiny patch I basically combined the only two Qt Base module `JNI_OnLoad` calls into one. At runtime it goes swimmingly and the GUI loads.\r\n\r\nThis dependency on `JNI_OnLoad` for init and the linker confusion it causes is perhaps something that can be improved upstream. I haven't seen it documented anywhere except in [QTBUG-32618](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-32618).",
