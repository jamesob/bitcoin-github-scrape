    "body": "This was more complicated than I expected, so careful review would probably be a good idea. Possible things worth focusing on:\r\n\r\n * Maybe the default block min fee should be left as is, so miners have deliberately/voluntarily lower minimum fees?\r\n * I've not looked much at the estimation code, any maybe I'm misunderstanding how it works. And my code could have bugs.\r\n * There's no tests for upgrading the fee estimates; \"it works for me\", but that's probably not really good enough...\r\n * Setting the default incremental relay fee higher than the minrelaytxfee causes init.cpp to automatically raise the minrelaytxfee to match, so I've set it as lower rather than the same, or changing that logic. I think lower makes sense, because an update to a tx probably imposes less cost on the network than an entire new tx. Not sure though.\r\n * Not a fan of all the hardcoding in the tests wrt min fee rates, but didn't see a reasonable way of generalising them either.",

Note that wallet defaults already have a higher incremental fee, so this would improve consistency.\r\n\r\n * (long term, not for this PR) it might be nice if min incremental relay fees were dynamically determined based on how much traffic there is -- if there's no traffic, updating a tx doesn't need to cost anything significant; if there's lots of traffic, or a spam attack, updating a tx should become as expensive as issuing a new tx (ie, incremental relay fee should be as high as mempool minfee, which may be well above the min relay fee)\r\n",
