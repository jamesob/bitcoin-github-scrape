    "body": "Thanks for the feedback! It looks like Ubuntu is the exception to me.\r\n\r\nI'm _not_ a Linux expert, but based on the research I just did it looks like `/usr/lib/systemd/system` is still the default path for most other distributions (making Debian/Ubuntu the exception). \r\n\r\nI was trying to keep my change as minimal as possible but I agree that assuming latest and adding notes to the more outdated or non-default options would be clearer. Would it be preferred to change the first comment to this:\r\n\r\n`NOTE: When installing for systemd in Debian/Ubuntu the .service file needs to be copied to the /lib/systemd/system directory instead.`\r\n\r\nAnd to add a second comment in the Upstart section mentioning that it is no longer the default? Like this:\r\n\r\n`Upstart was the default init system for Debian/Ubuntu versions older than 15.04. If you are using version 15.04 or newer and haven't manually configured upstart you should follow the systemd instructions instead.`\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Debian/Ubuntu mentioned in the header for Upstart, I tried those steps first myself before getting stuck.",

    "body": "@DaveFromBinary \r\n\r\nFrom what I understand /etc/systemd/system is used to override /(usr)/lib/systemd/system/\r\nThe system should not write anything in /etc (in theory), it's our space.\r\nI would put the service file to /etc/systemd/system and reserve /lib/systemd/system/  for the system, it has a lot of pre-installed service files (or units to employ the systemd term).  \r\n\r\nAlso, systemd has multiple instances, one for the system, and one instance by user connected.\r\nSo I am wondering if we can use the user's service manager for managing and configuring the bitcoin service, which will operate on our user's service manager, not the one of the system. But it can cause other headaches. \r\nSee this link: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#How_it_works",
