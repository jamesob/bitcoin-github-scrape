And since I'm adding a flag, there's no reason it can't be '-logtimestamp=<off | numeric | human-readable>'.\n\nWhat was the privacy concern, do you remember?\n\nMy plan is to modify OutputDebugStringF to accept two parameters, one indicating the verbosity level (off, critical error, error, warning, info, debug, verbose) and the other a bitmask enum indicating the area the log entry relates to, such as Mining, Transactions, Blocks, etc. (I got tired of wading through quite literally thousands of IRC log messages, and generating a log file around 1.2M per day). Oh, and then change all 'printf' statements to OutputDebugStringF( x, y where x and y make sense given the context.\n\nI already have that code in my local source, but it's based on the previous release and it's currently hard-coded to Debug, Mining.\n",
