We now substituting the system font by a non-Chinese-capable  font.\n\nI think a quick fix could be to check within the 10.10 'if structur' if the users language is zh_CN (maybe there are others?) then substitute the font to \"Henti TC\" (OS X standard font for Chinese). A one or two-liner with low risks (only Chinese 10.10 users will see the change).\nEasy, sane, effective IMO.\n",

    "body": "Well that took quite a bit of trial+error, but all good now. Fixes #5165. It's not optimal... Chinese font-names don't show in English (when you're in English and going to select Chinese/Japanese from the menu, those characters are blocks). After switching it works fine though.\n\nThe last commit avoids the hard-coded use of Arial, which does not always work correctly with Chinese. Seems sane to me, but I'm not sure if there was a specific reason for its use.\n\nThe substitutions are all wrapped up in ifdefs, so they're safe for master now and in the future. The only functional change for master (after we bump the sdk to 10.8) is the Arial change.\n\nTest binary here: https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/bitcoin-qt-10.6_quickfix3-437de97c\nAs far as I'm concerned, ready for merge/backport.\n",

The native osx implementation within the #ifdefs are sane because i did the most and i did always check during runtime if a method is available before calling it.\nOf course it's a hard admission in rc3 to change the building framework. But IMO it should be sane.\nI could also offer extensive testing in 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10.\n\nzh_CH:\n![bildschirmfoto-2015-01-17-um-08 40 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/5788122/8bb3b87c-9e25-11e4-9a4e-31aba25ca402.png)\n\nde_DE:\n![bildschirmfoto-2015-01-17-um-08 42 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/5788124/8ee41eba-9e25-11e4-94d4-ffffed27e1d1.png)\n\nja:\n![bildschirmfoto 2015-01-17 um 08 50 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/5788135/ef761b7a-9e25-11e4-9f4e-a971443002e9.png)\n\nFont mix in de_DE:\n![bildschirmfoto 2015-01-17 um 08 40 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178464/5788133/e8107290-9e25-11e4-90fd-0746f363e1f1.png)\n",
