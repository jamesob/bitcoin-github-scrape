    "body": "The more I think about this, the more I think we should drop the distinction between \"SOFT_FORK\" and \"CONSENSUS\" altogether.  At least when it comes to block processing, the only concept that matters is CONSENSUS.\r\n\r\nThe reason we care to distinguish SOFT_FORK from CONSENSUS is to highlight recent rule changes that our peers may not know about, so that the net_processing layer can optionally do something different for SOFT_FORK violations than it would do for CONSENSUS violations.  However I don't think this is a terribly meaningful distinction.  The main goals of the net_processing/net layers, with respect to these validation issues, is:\r\n * keep us connected to the honest network\r\n * prevent attackers from DoS'ing us\r\n * don't needlessly partition old nodes that have fallen back to SPV security because they're unaware of the consensus rules\r\n\r\nSo what is our strategy for each of these points?  For keeping us connected to the honest network, I think we mainly rely on having robust outbound peers -- any outbound peer that is not enforcing all the consensus rules should be disconnected.  Combined with the mitigations we deployed last fall for outbound peers whose tips aren't keeping up, and for protection in the case that our tip hasn't advanced in a while, I believe this is sufficient.  (See https://gist.github.com/sdaftuar/c2a3320c751efb078a7c1fd834036cb0 for more details around my thinking here.)\r\n\r\nFor not needlessly partitioning old nodes -- I think it's sufficient to not disconnect inbound peers that relay blocks that violate consensus rules, regardless of whether the rule is a recent soft fork or not.\r\n\r\nAnd to prevent DoS -- I think we just ensure that any blocks have valid proof-of-work, combined with protections against processing blocks that are too far behind our tip (or on a too-little-work-chain).\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases, I don't think we need to distinguish \"SOFT_FORK\" from \"CONSENSUS\".  And as its pretty arbitrary about when to decide to move something from the SOFT_FORK designation to CONSENSUS, I think we may as well not bother.",

If someone changes CheckInputs() in the future to return other TX invalid-reasons, then this logic won't be correct, and this would be an easy oversight.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that we always overwrite the reason here to be CONSENSUS (leaving in the comment about potentially needing to be careful to distinguish between RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE in the future) so that this logic -- which only triggers in the case where we're not doing parallel script checks -- matches the invalid reason given at line 2051 below.",
