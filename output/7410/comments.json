No vote needed; everyone knows they have to upgrade by that time. There can still be a miner vote after that 1 year to be sure miners _also_ agree to the change, and know we'll end up with a secure chain after the fork, but that's just belt and suspenders.\n",

Rather, the first _valid_ chain, conforming to the rules of the Bitcoin system with the most work is the preferred one.\n\nBitcoin nodes absolutely ignore chains which violate the rules of the system. A miner producing an invalid block is, from the perspective of the Bitcoin network, simply not mining at all. This operation is an essential component of the incentive balance which keeps the system working, limiting the potential abuse of high hashpower attacks to reorganization or exclusion of transactions and not arbitrary rule violation, creation of inflation, etc.\n\nBitcoin is a system which was created to mitigate the harms and costs that result from the reliance on third party trust in other systems of money. It is not a system created to instill ultimate trust in a collection of self-selecting anonymous third parties, but rather one that extends them only the absolute minimum trust necessary, carefully confined and balanced by hard rules and economic incentives.\n",

By virtue of Bitcoin being the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency on this planet, and because everyone will always regard it as such. \n\nCould miners create a longer chain which is not \"Bitcoin\": Yes. Will they? No, not for any significant amount of time. \n\nCan Bitcoin split exactly through the middle and create two Bitcoin's? Well that is so unlikely that it is not really worth exploring. One will always be called Bitcoin, and the other Bitcoin Something. \n\nLike the great Eminem once said:  I am whatever you say I am. \n\nThe big (on topic) question is: Can a less valuable cryptocurrency still be more secure? And if it is more secure, wouldn't it become more valuable anyway? \n\nSome realities might simply be unescapable. Like the need for politics. \n",

    "body": "> \"when miners misbehave\" - really?\n\nYes, let's (for the sake of discussion, worst case) say an organiation steals or otherwise acquires 99% of all double-sha256 mining power, and decides to censor all transactions, or otherwise wreak havoc on the chain.\nPeople running node software could then decide that that is not the bitcoin they want, and switch to software with a different mining algorithm whose distribution of computation hardware is more balanced.\nAs said it is a nuclear option, and obviously everyone would prefer that that is not necessary, but it is not impossible. You can't force people to partake in a bitcoin that was 'ruined' for them.\n",
