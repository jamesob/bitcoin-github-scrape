    "body": ">  it brings existing variant code into alignment with the std::variant API\r\n\r\nIt does not. The boost::variant and std::variant APIs are not identical. The API variant that is introduced in this pull is identical to *neither* of the \"official\" ones. So if this is merged, we will end up with three APIs to keep in mind and maintain. I just don't see the value of spending time on review when the changes here can be done (in theory) with a trivial scripted diff. See https://github.com/MarcoFalke/bitcoin-core/pull/new/2005-StdVariantScriptedDiff\r\n\r\nThe changes here are already complicated and they even miss the most complicated part (boost visitor).\r\n\r\nFeel free to disagree, but going forward, I am hoping to see something like #18863 merged for 0.21, so that the diff in my branch is reduced for 0.22.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(although I don't quite understand why only that)\r\n\r\nThe reason why only a `T&&` overload is needed is that when `T` is a template type, there are template deduction rules that let `T` be deduced to be an lvalue reference, so the function can be called with both lvalue and rvalue arguments. (This is needed for \"perfect forwarding\"). If `T` was a normal type and not a template type, you would need to have both `T&` and `T&&` overloads to accept lvalues and rvalues.",
