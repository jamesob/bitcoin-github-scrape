    "body": "@morcos here's #6449 on top of #6416 : https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/morcos-6449-over-6416\n\nStaging replacements and then remove them at the end of AcceptToMemoryPool in some way or another has been something that many people have tried, but working on alternatives to the \"first seen\" spend conflicts resolution policy was never a priority. Now it seems more priority than ever: apart from capping the mempool, we need some form of RBF so that people can bid up their transactions.\nBut it is more prioritary to cap the mempool, fine.\nFortunately, some of the first required steps for a \"full mempool replacement policy\" are the same as what  \"spend conflicts replacement policies\" needs.\nWill that mean that some of those common steps for zerconf-safe-RBF will be taken sooner because it's a priority for the mempool cap?\nI'm afraid no, any work on this direction, as well as any other improvement to AcceptToMemoryPool() [like #6445 #6420 #6068 ] will be frozen (or mousewheel rebased) until #6421 is fully finished, discussed, tested, merged and improved by later PRs. The reasoning being that, \"anything that is simple to do before should be simple to do later\".\n@sipa @laanwj I hope I'm wrong about my prediction, but if that's the plan I would prefer to know it as soon as possible to close this and some other PRs ( #6448 #6445 #6420 #6068) until #6421.\nEven though I believe some of the work mempool-cap work can be greatly simplified and made less disruptive to the rest of the development precisely after those PRs, if I'm the only who believes so, I guess it's just better that I close my related PRs so that people can focus their \"mental power\" in reviewing only #6421 and PRs based on it.\n",

    "body": "@morcos I would prefer to even go further with the preparations and move more things out of main, see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/policy-replacement-alt (which is closer to #6449 ), but I think it is unlikely that those kind of changes are welcomed for 0.11.1 (even thought it would mean that we can safely change AcceptToMemoryPool in 0.12.99 without having to worry about generating conflicts for a solution that can be backported to 0.11). What I'm trying to avoid is that other changes to AcceptToMemoryPool (of which I maintain many) get locked until 0.11.1, but maybe it's a lost cause... \nWhat do you think @laanwj ?\n",
