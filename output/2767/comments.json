The only substantial code move is moving WalletDB.h functions to its implementation file.\n\nThere's problems with compiling the tests after this, though (see pulltester output).\n\n```\ntest/script_tests.cpp: In function 'CScript ParseScript(std::string)':\ntest/script_tests.cpp:47: error: 'replace_first' was not declared in this scope\n```\n",

They don't remove actual code dependencies, but they hide them. Of course we're already using them, and the compilation performance improvements it gives may be worth it. Other devs opinions?\n- Regarding uint64 and int64: I'd prefer including stdint.h and using int64_t and uint64_t instead, over redeclaring them all over the place.\n\n@CodeShark Mind taking a look at this? Does it interfere with the dependencies cleanup?\n",

    "body": "It is not intentional at all.  The idea is that if and only if we can replace a header dependency with a forward declare, do so.  Additionally (and this is harder to do), if there are indirect dependencies, add them to be a direct dependency.\n\nMy method to find direct dependencies has been to remove the header(s) that resolve the dependency (using doxygen to find indirect includes of a given header), and analyze the error messages to see if the file actually uses the header.  If so see if we can optimize the header out with forward declares, and if not make sure we #include it directly.\n\nThe method to find indirect dependencies has been to assume they will show up as un-related build errors and make them work.\n\nAll of this being said, I don't know the project well enough to know exactly where things are, so my methods have a certain amount of flaws in them.  This is one of the reasons why I say that there will be a major need to review the changes I make.\n\nI will do my best to resolve the issues you mentioned above and squash any others that come up.\n",

It looks like the tester is trying to build without setting HAVE_CONFIG_H. \n\nOn Sep 15, 2013, at 9:51 PM, BitcoinPullTester notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Automatic sanity-testing: FAILED BUILD/TEST, see http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/10a08c93b5c7bc3dfb141da377a604a59599913c for binaries and test log.\n> \n> This could happen for one of several reasons:\n> 1. It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n> 2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n> 3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n> 4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n> 5.
