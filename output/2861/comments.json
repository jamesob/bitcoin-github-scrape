To get that same functionality with watch-only wallets, this becomes dependent on multiwallet, which doesn't seem to be making any progress.\n",

Instead of having to rely on blockchain.info to get information about addresses not owned by myself, I can monitor these addresses using my own node. The same goes for other Bitcoin services. I suspect a lot of people depend on the blockchain.info JSON API simply because they have no other option right now. I know at least one service whose developer I spoke with using the blockchain.info API because they're the only ones offering a way to pull data about addresses for which one doesn't own the private key.\n\nEvery time blockchain.info has problems, or gets DDOSed, my service is unable to continue because I have no way of retrieving this information in a decentralized manner. It becomes a single point of failure for many of the smaller Bitcoin-related services.\n\nI agree that separate, watch-only wallets would be preferable, but at the same time I don't see why it has to be an either-or issue.\n",

It is nonsense that we have to rely on blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info while having the entire blockchain stored on our own node.\n\nCurrently bitcoind doesn't have a friendly API for merchants and payment services providers. It is crucial to be able to handle tens of thousands of addresses for which we don't want to share the private keys with a certain copy of bitcoind.\n\nIt would be really cool to have this merged ASAP without creating dependencies on other not yet developed features.\n\nTo show how people overcomplicate this: The best would be to simply have an RPC call which queries the database for a certain address, as a one-off query. No need to add it to any wallets, manage it, etc. Just query the database for it. Make getreceivedbyaddress work with _any_ address. That's all we need.\n\nI really appreciate the work put into this branch, in fact we live off it for quite some time now. Would love to see this merged.\n\nThanks for listening!\n",

I just dropped a generated raw transaction onto blockchain.info's tx send with one of the unspent transactions, and it removed the unspent from `listunspent`, but it didn't change the balance for the account that the address is associated with.\n\nI didn't send it through my bitcoind instance, so that may be why that's happening, I need to do another test and send through my local bitcoind.

    "body": "@kyledrake Accounts are not addresses, and do not have _anything_ to do with the coins available to an address. The abstraction provided by the reference client has at no point any concept of a \"balance of an address\", only \"balance of a wallet\".\n\nAddresses are associated with accounts, and coins received by those address will credit the account. For debits, you need to explicitly use \"sendfrom\".\n\nAccounts are just virtual counters, and they can even go negative. I don't see a useful way to combine them with watch-only addresses. I think in general that their use is very limited, and in most cases what people really want is multiple individual wallets.\n",

In fact, I'd vote that the default label for importaddress be \"watchonly\" (or \"imported\" -- don't care about the name) instead of \"\".\n\nRE: documentation: How about: importaddress help says something like:\n\nAdds an address that can be watched as if it were in your wallet, but cannot\nbe used to spend. Transactions to or from watch-only addresses will appear\nin listtransactions and listunspent and will be counted in getbalance, but\nare not spendable without the private key. Watch-only addresses may be\nmade spendable by importing the corresponding private key using\nimportprivkey.\n",

    "body": "@luke-jr `importaddress` doesn't do a rescan if you pass \"false\" as the third (rescan) parameter. So the approach for batch imports of watch-only addresses would be to add all your addresses except the last one with rescan=false, and add the last one with rescan=true.\n\nThinking about my use cases, I don't think I would have any use case for a mixed watch-only/regular wallet. Ie. I wouldn't have a need for a wallet containing private keys that can spend money, _and_ a wallet containing watch-only addresses. To me, the whole point of watch-only addresses is not letting bitcoind manage private keys for added security. Either for use with a web service (which can be a blockchain.info-style site, or a web wallet), or a local Armory-style wallet, where an external program handles the wallet, and only uses bitcoind to maintain the blockchain and query it about relevant transactions.\n\nAs Armory functions now, it uses bitcoind to maintain the blockchain, but not to query information from it. Armory scans the entire blockchain (loads the raw \"blkxxxxx.dat\" files) on startup, and to deduce the balance for the wallets maintained by Armory. If these watch-only extensions were to become available, Armory could add the relevant addresses using the `importaddress` function, and let bitcoind gather information on these addresses. To me this would be the first step in separating the wallet functionality from bitcoind.\n\nI agree that mixing these two address types can be confusing - even though it has to be done manually - so I would much rather have the ability to have either a watch-only wallet or a wallet with private keys than nothing at all, although I'm not sure how much work that would be to implement.\n\nAnother solution would be to add watch-only versions of the relevant affected RPC calls. Ie. using `wogetbalance` to get the balance of watch-only addresses, `wolistunspent` to list unspent transactions for watch-only addresses etc. Another option would be to include an optional [includewatchonly=false] parameter to the relevant RPC calls, as another solution to make sure we don't break existing installations. I agree with Gavin that this is an important concern.\n",

I can use `listtransactions` to see them, but I can't filter it on bitcoind itself using an array of addresses, so I would have scaling issues after a certain point if I used it for a site running a lot of transactions.\n\nIdeally it would be nice to see a list of transactions filtered by an array of addresses, similar to how listunspent can be used.\n\nI'm not saying this is a problem for this commit (and you mentioned this issue above), I'm just adding this info incase anyone was interested. I will work around this by scanning the transactions manually for now, and try to come up with a longer term solution later on.\n\nUpdate: Actually I won't be able to do a listransactions dump either, because there isn't really a way to see the source of the sends in the output except via the transaction id. I'll probably have to keep track of transactions/txids on my end.\n",

Because both parties need to be involved you'd be able to implement useful features like daily spending limits, 2-factor-authentication to keep coins safe even if the user's computer is completely compromised, and safe instant transfers between users, while still preventing coins from being stolen if the server itself is hacked.\n",

    "body": "@keo It seems I never replied to your comment, but what may seem as overcomplication is rather the opposite.\n\nBeing able to always query information about any address's history, requires a rather large index to be maintained (multiple gigabytes). Using that for a simple wallet service means you become dependent on such an index, and your system will for example not be compatible with block chain pruning (not storing old parts of the block chain on disk). And most of all, it isn't needed for normal operation. Contrary to how many people see the system, internally it doesn't work with addresses at all - those are just part of an authentication layer on top of transactions (implemented through scripts).\n\nFor anyone just needing information about some wallet, where potentially not all keys are known, this is a much more efficient and scalable solution.\n",

    "body": "My testing indicates that Coin Control #2343 and Watch Only operate fine independently, but the combination has issues.\n\nhttps://github.com/litecoin-project/bitcoinomg/commits/bitcoin-omg-0.8\nHere is my branch of Bitcoin 0.8.5 where I initially tried to add watchonly to coin control by filtering out the watchonly outputs in AvailableCoins().  That succeeded in excluding the unspendable coins from the selection dialog, Coin Control appears to calculate the tx size and fee correctly, but then things go wrong after you Send.\n\nOne transaction I attempted had 67 inputs and was just under 10KB qualifying for free with a sufficiently high priority.  After send, the client ended up failing with the \"Transaction too large\" error, meaning the client thought the transaction was in excess of 100KB.  Another attempt with a 2KB transaction failed with an insufficient fee as the client thought the actual size was much larger than what Coin Control believed it to be.\n\nThe way Coin Control is currently structured it is uncertain if it can use watchonly's fSpendable as intended.  I also wonder if it would be useful to anything for it to be tri-state like IsMIne() instead of a boolean.\n",

This is arguable a problem on its own that needs fixing, but work around multiwallet support seems to have declined.\n- For effectively dealing with multisig transactions where you only have some of the required keys, you inevitably need some form of watch-only (in a wallet with actual keys) to use the raw transaction API, unless you're implementing an entire wallet from scratch\n- We effectively already have non-spendable coins in wallets, through `lockunspent`\n",

    "body": "@wtogami Agreed, that's a good way of creating a watch-only wallet right now.\n\nThe only feature missing then is to watch addresses that you have no private key for. This could be due to logistic reasons, ex. a \"shop\" server that wants to monitor that payments have come in, but cannot spend them. Or multisig addresses that the user has only one of the keys to, but knows the P2SH address for.\n\nI think the \"importaddress\" idea is solid. But my irk about this implementation is that it combines spendable and non-spendable balances. This is only acceptable for read-only wallets.\n",

    "body": "@gavinandresen:\n\nMy apologies if this comes off as dramatic, but we're having a really hard time explaining how important this is, and I'm kindof at a loss for how to explain how important this pull request is, having tried so hard previously and failing to get attention.\n\nI want everybody reading this to take a moment of silence to ponder the tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars USD that have been stolen **because of storing private keys on the server**. Bitcoin security is in really bad shape. There's so much theft of Bitcoins these days, in such high amounts, that it makes bank heists look like shoplifting. This is not something the police are going to solve, we have to solve it. We have to get more serious about security, and providing safer mechanisms for dealing with Bitcoin. **That's what this pull request does.**\n\nWhat this pull request does is turn bitcoind into a listener node you don't need to trust anymore, and as such, this is **the most important addition to bitcoind ever.** It is critically important for hybrid wallets that we don't disclose the private key to the server, ever. Coinpunk completely and utterly depends on it, and if this gets rejected, it endangers a new Bitcoin wallet. In that amount of time, several new hosted wallets will go online that use server-side key management because no alternative exists for them, which will create more honeypots for hackers, which will lead to more major wallet thefts.\n\nThere are at least a dozen Bitcoin startups using it in production (not just for Coinpunk, for many other things), and I don't want to see them forced to depend on an old unstable version of bitcoind that could lead to serious problems and possibly a blockchain fork involving a huge swath of Bitcoin users, which could cause a crash in the price of Bitcoin, or worse.\n\nIt's been tested heavily and not a single person has reported a problem yet.\n\nI **will not** use a replacement for this that requires the private keys, because it's dangerous and I won't do it. If there is a way to not disclose private keys and have this same functionality that's through a different mechanism, document it in this thread and I will gladly switch to it. But anything involving private keys is a total deal breaker.\n\nAll the work is done. We're one merge away, and Bitcoin immediately becomes a more secure, better ecosystem. That merge will give developers safer tools to work with Bitcoin, and will probably save millions of dollars from future theft.\n\nAnyone interested in using this, please +1. And please merge this pull request. Thank you.\n",

    "body": "@petertodd The problem is that once you introduce certain functionality, people start relying on the interface to be in that way, and it is very difficult to change it again.\n\nOne example of this is the \"account\" system. It is extremely unintuitive in various ways, does strange things in interaction with labels (and the GUI). But we're kind of stuck there. Everyone wants accounts to work in their preferred way, but doing anything to it breaks backwards compatibility in possibly dangerous ways.\n\nSo -- we need to get this (the RPC interface, not so much the implementation) right the first time.\n\n**IMHO** the only solution that can satisfy everyone is to get rid of wallet functionality in bitcoind (split it off, not delete it), and provide an interface for wallet software to connect to. @kyledrake and others can then use their own custom wallet without depending on us. In principle the wallet functionality is a distraction from the purpose of bitcoind which is to run a validating node for the P2P network.\n",

    "body": "@laanwj Yes, and we agree on that. When the wallet functionality is split off interfaces can be gradually moved to whatever they should be. But given people are using this in production and semi-production, that's saying it's got direct real-world uses and maybe the interface is actually working. Once people's usage strategies settle down a bit, maybe our ideas of what was a perfect RPC interface will turn out to be wrong anyway - I myself can think of times where mixing funds that have full keys and funds that need additional signatures from elsewhere to be spent would be useful.

    "body": "@laanwj People are _already_ relying on this interface, because they desperately needed it. Rejecting this pull request doesn't prevent that, it causes more problems. Sometimes we can't control how open source software is used. The street finds its own use for things, and the street is using watch-only addresses. We should recognize that this is happening and help people solve the most important problem with Bitcoin right now: security.\n\nGetting the RPC interface right (I'm using it right now, and I have no changes, it's perfect for what I'm doing anyway), and splitting off the RPC are different goals, and I really don't think we should reject this pull request because of an ongoing purity debate regarding the wallet code in bitcoind. There's always warts in APIs, but I actually think the RPC interface in Bitcoin is pretty good. I've worked with HTTP APIs for years, and I would say it's one of the best interfaces I've ever worked with (The Facebook API was a nightmare in comparison). @gavinandresen's improvements to raw transaction were well done and very helpful.\n\nI agree with you that splitting off is a good thing and I support that, but how does holding back on this pull request right now prevent you from splitting it off later? Let's not let bitcoind fall into disrepair while having this discussion. Let's make it better right now, and split off the code later. This merge is so simple it could be put in the next release of Bitcoind, but the code splitting probably needs another major version, so it's a good partition to do it this way.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to be at the Subway in Allentown, PA that accepts Bitcoin, and I'm going to demo the first-ever pure HTML QR-based POS transaction ever done, and it's going to be based on Coinpunk, which is based on this pull request. This is significant, because it's a mobile Bitcoin wallet that supports QR that **Apple can't ban**, which is another major problem we've been having. If that's not a good use case of this pull request, I don't know what is. Please help me solve these problems. I can write the code on my side, but I can't merge this code in. Throw me a bone here, I'll make it worth your time. Thank you.\n",

    "body": "@wtogami I appreciate the workaround and it's interesting, but if I understand it, it can't be dynamically changed efficiently without exposing private keys and restarting servers. A hacker with a packet sniffer would be able to read all of the incoming keys unless it was being transferred remotely. For my use case, the private key must never touch the server.\n\nI can't speak for everyone, but a \"fully watch-only mode where privkeys are disabled\" is a perfectly fine solution for my needs and I could use that.\n\nNo disrespect intended for the great work on Coin Control, but IMHO, this pull request is more important than Coin Control. Lack of anonymity hasn't caused nearly as many problems as private keys on servers. The list of thefts from Bitcoin servers is long and terrifying to read: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83794.0\n",

Having to setup and run your own block explorer to find unspent outputs for addresses that are not in your wallet is very bad.\n\nBy being able to query confirmed/unconfirmed balance and find unspent outputs..etc of addresses that you do not directly own... you can then build more secure apps around bitcoin handling spending and such in the browser.. only using bitcoind to push the transactions. \n",

Upon quick inspection, it appears to be also not designed for my use (I'm not writing an anarchist-themed C++ application), but trying to implement it via FFI might be an interesting experiment. If I did consider doing that, I would still like to design Coinpunk to be usable by both clients.

I documented my steps which was really just \"git checkout -b remotes/origin/importaddress\" before compiling. No matter what I try now, I get method not found.\n\nDesperately need this command to build a POS system for restaurants which are waiting on me. Cannot have private key on the terminal. Help?\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I think I got it. Now see importaddress in the src files. Just want to say thanks for this feature. There will soon be several restaurants accepting bitcoin without any worry that the private key can be stolen by employees/customers. To anyone needing this amazing feature, use:\n\"git clone -b watchonly https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin.git\"\n",
