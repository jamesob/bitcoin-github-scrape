    "body": "## Future work \r\nto be addressed either in this PR or a follow up: \r\n- persist rebroadcast attempt tracker to disk\r\n- remove wallet dependency for `p2p_rebroadcast.py` \r\n\r\n## Merge Plan & Next Steps:\r\nAll of the functionality in this PR is hidden behind a configuration switch that defaults to off, and the wallet rebroadcast logic is currently untouched. The idea is to make these changes as safe as possible to merge into master, and allow reviewers to easily enable and observe the new rebroadcast mechanism in today\u2019s network conditions. \r\n\r\nIf we build confidence that these changes are safe and desirable, we can default enable this new node rebroadcast logic and disable the legacy wallet rebroadcast logic. This is the desired end goal. \r\n\r\n## Project History: \r\nA version of these changes were originally proposed in #16698. \r\n\r\n#18038 broke out a subset of the functionality, enabling the node to provide a guarantee around minimal initial broadcast & reducing the frequency of the existing wallet rebroadcast functionality (unbroadcast set) \r\n\r\nSince #16698, there have been some changes in approach, and all of the unbroadcast conversation is no longer relevant. So, to help with review, I've decided to open a new PR. To preserve the relevant feedback and concerns, I've tried my best to capture the history of conversations in the following write-up: https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin-notes/blob/main/rebroadcast-history.md. warning: it goes quite in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd Huge shout out to the village of core contributors who have provided feedback & guidance on this project so far. Honestly too many to name, but this project is much better for it. Thank you :) \r\n",

    "body": "This seems like a big win, both for privacy and for quality of service. There are a lot of nodes out there with larger-than-default mempools, and if this were the default, they would serve as reservoirs for transactions that were dropped from the default mempool, eventually rebroadcasting them when they noticed that they had a chance of getting confirmed. This would save users from sometimes having to manually intervene to unstick stuck transactions.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to log whenever this logic kicks in and rebroadcast transactions. Perhaps just the number of transactions that it's rebroadcasting, i.e. `Rebroadcasting 23 transactions`, and maybe also the individual transaction IDs.\r\n\r\nI'd like to run this code on mainnet, and having logging statements would be very helpful for tracking how it actually behaves.",

    "body": "@casey thanks for taking a look! \r\n\r\nThe current code does have some logging, the most relevant statement firing here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.cpp&file-filters%5B%5D=.h&file-filters%5B%5D=.py&file-filters%5B%5D=.sh#diff-7dff50848db96bdb8edffc4d21daeca6d9050ec0e67d96072780ea5751e7df06R90. This prints the transactions hashes where a rebroadcast will be attempted for all peers. Those candidates will go through additional per-peer filters (see SendMessages code that copies `setInventoryTxToSend` and `filterInventoryKnown`), so might not actually make it to every peer, but should be sufficient signal for us to monitor the frequency of rebroadcast. \r\n\r\nI've also added logs to monitor how long it takes to calculate rebroadcast blocks. The logs are all in the `NET` & `BENCH` categories. I'm currently running a node with this patch, but I'd love to gather more data so It'd be helpful if you are willing to run the patch and share your findings. \r\n\r\nSo far, I ran a node for 1 week with default mempool settings & 0 transactions were selected for rebroadcast. That seems reasonable. I'm now running a node with a larger mempool, and also want to tinker with making low fee rate wallet transactions to monitor node rebroadcast logic.\r\n\r\nIf you've intended to request more logging than what's currently there, I'm open to suggestions.

Tests passed.\r\n\r\n> Conceptually, we want to rebroadcast transactions that we believe \u201cshould\u201d have been mined by now.\r\n\r\nNot sure about this part. Can we randomly rebroadcast different transactions to make it difficult for spy nodes to notice any pattern?\r\n\r\nI used below `bitcoin.conf`:\r\n```\r\ntestnet=1\r\nrebroadcast=1\r\ndebug=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHad 1 incoming and 1 outgoing transaction pending associated with my wallet (segwit,rbf,1sat/vB).

Only one line related to `rebroadcast`:\r\n\r\n`2021-03-13T00:34:03Z Caching minimum fee for rebroadcast to 1.000 sat/vB, took 122 \u00b5s to calculate.`\r\n\r\n> After we process a block, invoke the rebroadcast module to identify if there\r\nare any transactions we would have expected to be included, and queue them up\r\nfor relay to our peers.\r\n\r\nMaybe it couldn't find any transactions that should be rebroadcasted based on fee rate and other things.\r\n\r\n> In order to prevent spam, we need to carefully select which transactions to rebroadcast. As of this commit, we select the transactions in the mempool that have the highest feerate.\r\n\r\nCan you explain the SPAM part mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061/commits/b86f6d90a844dd71008f7c8a5fb92a1ac8673891? \r\n\r\nChecked unit tests and functional test included in this PR.

    "body": "@prayank23 I think you're confused about the goal of this PR. The current problem is that rebroadcasting is something that _only_ happens for your own transactions. Any peer that observes rebroadcasting knows for a fact that it is yours. This PR changes things so that rebroadcasting is done uniformly for *all* transactions, without special treatment of your own. By definition, if the fact whether a transaction is yours is no longer used in the decision to rebroadcast or not, there is no signal any peer can infer anything from.\r\n\r\nThat obviously does not prevent spy nodes from learning other things (like observing which nodes broadcast first to infer origin), but it categorically removes rebroadcasting behavior from the set of leaks.",

    "body": "> This PR adds 1 thing: New pattern (fee rate and time in mempool)\r\n\r\nI see what you mean now. Indeed, it does, but I think this is completely negligible. What it leaks about the mempool is on a scale of 30 minutes to hours. Within such amounts of time, we already reveal the transactions we've learned (simply by telling other nodes in the process of normal relay, every few seconds). The concern about privacy here is on the scale of seconds or less - by knowing which nodes see a transaction first an attacker can infer its origin. Revealing what was in your mempool 30 minutes ago is a non-issue.\r\n\r\nFeerate is already revealed (infrequently & quantized) through BIP133 feefilter messages.\r\n\r\n> It makes things different but not difficult for spy nodes.\r\n\r\nI disagree here. This change completely removes the issue of learning which transactions belong to a node based on rebroadcasting behavior, which is an enormous leak.\r\n\r\n> What is wrong with my comments? Random txs and time decided by users\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"random txs\"?\r\n\r\nTime decided by users: generally the criterion for deciding whether a parameter should be configurable is whether you can also give advice under which cases users should be changing it, and how. I don't know what advice I'd give users except not to touch it; setting it very low could become a privacy issue (using the mechanism you point out), setting it very high may make it useless; things in between probably hardly matter. Do you have a scenario in mind under which you'd suggest changing it?\r\n\r\n> Nobody knows what \"should\" be mined except miners\r\n\r\nThat is literally what the mempool is: a node's prediction of what will be mined in the near future. It doesn't matter that this prediction is sometimes wrong.\r\n\r\n> and that 30 minutes time frame is weird for Bitcoin\r\n\r\nReal world protocol implementations are full of arbitrary-seeming constants.",

I agree with you this change completely removes the issue of learning which transactions belong to a node based on rebroadcasting behavior, which is an enormous leak.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/112599666-41e77c80-8e36-11eb-8cea-b487903dc4ae.png)\r\n\r\n> What do you mean by \"random txs\"?\r\n\r\nRandomization can be done using different algorithms. But a basic random rebroadcast would ignore filtering based on fee rate. Example: Mempool has 10 txs. A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J. Using this PR, ABCD are rebroadcasted but in my case AB rebroadcasted once and maybe AED next time if still not confirmed and almost same mempool. Again this suggestion can be ignored and I saw 1sat/vByte being used for filtering when I tried on testnet. Maybe need to do more tests and use mainnet as well.\r\n\r\n> Real world protocol implementations are full of arbitrary-seeming constants.\r\n\r\nI was suggesting to use either a default value like 30 minutes and user can change it if required. Or decide a MIN and MAX so that anything between this range can be used else default 30 minutes will be used.\r\n\r\nSometimes we don't see any blocks for more than 30 minutes in Bitcoin and few blocks are mined in couple of minutes gap. Considering this it would have been better if there was some algorithm that could adjust the value for us automatically within a range based on last N blocks. But it can also be done manually or we could just ignore this suggestion and do in follow up PRs if required.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/112601480-8411bd80-8e38-11eb-814a-78dfd6f2bf62.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Concept ACK: this removes the rebroadcasting privacy leak\n\nI found the your [summary](https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin-notes/blob/main/rebroadcast-history.md) of the previous discussion very helpful and still want to think though some of the edge cases in regards to e.g. bandwidth usage (which I think is already in a good state).\n\n--- \n\n@prayank23 I'm not sure I understood your concern with the constant min-age of 30min before consider to rebroadcast a transaction. This exists to limit the bandwidth usage (see the summary linked above if you haven't already read it). I think having this configurable doesn't add anything.\n\n---\n\nI've been comparing the contents of block templates to the actual blocks (with the goal detecting miners censoring transactions; unrelated to this PR). One edge case I've observed a few times is: \nA transaction `tx1` is missing from 100+ blocks it \"should have been in\". Manually rebroadcasting fails as there exists a conflicting and better propagated transaction `tx2` paying a substantially lower feerate. (This essentially a real-world observation of what @gmaxwell mentioned at the end of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#issuecomment-571399346 as a potential bandwidth attack). \n\nA naive implemention would try to rebroadcast `tx1` for each of the 100+ blocks until `tx2` confirms. I haven't checked your code, but based on the summary this would be mitigated by only rebroadcasting the transaction every 4h and not more than six times total. I don't think adding 'do-not-re-rebroadcast-previously-rejected/conflicting-tx'-logic is worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And this will be because miners' algo for composing a block differ from ours, not necessary because the transactions are not well propagated.\r\n\r\nIs this too aggressive, possibly creating unnecessary traffic?

    "body": "thank you all SO MUCH for these reviews \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd I believe I have addressed all outstanding review comments \ud83c\udf89 I have one more piece of functionality I'd like to implement in this patch ([link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061#discussion_r596515495)), but otherwise everything in this PR should be current and ready for further review.\r\n\r\nMy next step is to develop a patch for more insightful monitoring. I've been running this patch on mainnet for the past 2 weeks, and have seen results very similar to what aj reported [in this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061#issuecomment-820030611). However, my main curiosity is how many of these transactions queued for rebroadcast 1. actually get `inv`ed to the network & 2. are subsequently requested via a `getdata`? Once I've written that, I'll share here incase anyone else is interested in running. \r\n\r\nA couple more conceptual responses:\r\n\r\n@0xB10C really cool that you're doing a very similar comparison, I'd be curious to learn more about how this patch compares to what you are running. I agree that the attempt tracker will mitigate & cap the worst case of something like this.\r\n\r\n@vasild it seems like your questions are highlighting two tensions that we are aiming to strike a balance between: \r\n1. privacy vs propagation\r\n2. propagation vs bandwidth \r\n\r\nWhile this patch uses `getblocktemplate` logic as a starting point for identifying which transactions to attempt to rebroadcast, there is a lot of nuance to ensure that we don't waste bandwidth (such as the attempt tracker). I'd suggest looking at the `GetRebroadcastTransaction` function ([link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.cpp&file-filters%5B%5D=.h&file-filters%5B%5D=.py&file-filters%5B%5D=.sh#diff-7dff50848db96bdb8edffc4d21daeca6d9050ec0e67d96072780ea5751e7df06R78)) to see the various filters being applied. However, after they are selected, they will also need to pass through `filterInventoryKnown` before they actually make it as a network message. The monitoring I mentioned above will help us observe the numbers around that.\r\n\r\nIf we find that the number of transactions currently being rebroadcast is too high, the suggestion of looking at the last N blocks seems like a good approach :)",

    "body": "I believe all review comments are now addressed (including the explanations below) \ud83c\udf88\r\n\r\nSome updates about the latest push: \r\n- The rebroadcast logic now mines a block with a weight of 3/4 weight-of-incoming-block instead of 3/4 weight-of-maximum-block, to reduce bandwidth spikes \r\n- Rebased on master to resolve a silent merge conflict \r\n- We now store the last two values for the fee-rate cache, so we can use the previous if there has been a run since the block came in\r\n\r\nOne more note- looks like the latest push has caused a lock-order failure in the TSan build. I will address this soon! \r\n\r\nAlso, I've been monitoring the code using [this branch](https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin/commits/2021-04-rebroadcast-monitoring2). In addition to a bunch of rebroadcast specific logging, the top commit adds two RPC endpoints: `getrebroadcastinfo` and `getgeneralbroadcastinfo` which reports counts of # of times we do events such as sending INVs and receiving GETDATAs. \r\n\r\nHere are a couple observations: \r\n- The patch has been running on my node with a huge mempool. I have `feefilter`: 0, `maxmempool`: 1000, `mempoolexpiry`:17520 (approx 2 years), and `minrelaytxfee`: 0, along with inbound connections enabled.\r\n- After running for a couple days, the rebroadcast INV:GETDATA ratio was 11-12:1, while the general ratio was 35-40:1. As the node ran for longer, both of these ratios have been reducing. After running for ~8 days, the rebroadcast ratio has been hovering around 9:1, and the general broadcast ratio has dropped to ~12:1. \r\n- The number of transactions identified for rebroadcast is very spiky, its often 0, or will hop up to 100-150 on a particular block. The latest push has changed the maximum weight to reflect the incoming block, so I'm curious to see \r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in reviewing or running the monitoring code, that would be awesome! I'd love to gather more data :) \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@fjahr \r\n\r\n> But it seems this could be exploited by an attacker at almost zero cost, spamming these nodes with such txs that are high fee but invalid under the new rules. \r\n\r\nHm, so indeed an attacker could essentially nullify the utility of a mempool by spamming old nodes with now-policy-invalid transactions, but this is already the case. \r\n\r\nIn relation to this PR, we want to make sure we don't worsen, or automate that behavior. So `m_attempt_tracker` ensures that there are bounds on the number of times & frequency that we will rebroadcast any particular transaction. Combined with the `filterInventoryKnown` functionality, we can have some guarantees around bandwidth usage, especially asymmetric bandwidth usage, that nodes will have under normal or malicious worst case scenarios. However, I am not aiming to fix the existing issue around policy upgrades and attack vectors. \r\n\r\nDoes this help / make sense? \r\n\r\n\r\n@ariard \r\n\r\n> A lot of second-layers nodes and more and more Bitcoin applications have their own RBF-able rebroadcast logics, with their own frequencies and attempt limits. This new mechanism doesn't serve them well as their rebroadcast logics are going to leak a behavior breaking from the anonymous sets constituted by m_attempt_tracker. \r\n\r\nI don't understand what you are trying to say here. I don't find it unexpected or undesirable for various applications, users, companies to run custom rebroadcast logic. I also don't understand why you say that `m_attempt_tracker` is creating an anonymity set- it mostly serves as a way to mitigate frequently rebroadcasting any particular transaction, not the technique we use to identify rebroadcasts. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Another concern, I think this PR is making the assumption that big-sized node mempools will serve as some sort of transaction archives for the rest of the network by rebroadcasting a-week-ago-or-month-ago bottom of mempools now feerate compelling for block inclusion ?\r\n\r\nYes I think that's a fair way of looking at the long picture vision. \r\n\r\n> Further, I would attend a more detailed privacy attacker model, we might have other privacy-preserving rebroadcast strategies with cheaper bandwidth trade-offs...\r\n\r\nI agree that there are many possibilities & that it would be beneficial to have a more specific breakdown of privacy assumptions & guarantees. However, I don't think that we should gate concrete improvements on theoretically infinite problem spaces. I believe that the changes proposed in this PR & the intended direction of this project offer concrete, auditable improvements to privacy around 3rd parties deducing the source wallet of a transaction. \r\n\r\n\r\n@DISC30 thanks for the offer, I don't think this PR is the right place to discuss, so I emailed you (based on the email in your github).

    "body": "@amitiuttarwar \r\n\r\n> I don't understand what you are trying to say here. I don't find it unexpected or undesirable for various applications, users, companies to run custom rebroadcast logic. \r\n\r\nI think the problem this work is alleguing to solve is \"How to improve Bitcoin Core Wallet rebroadcast privacy\". The solution proposed is to rebroadcast _any_ transaction identified as missing from a block based on feerate expectations. This new behavior is justifying to improve privacy for the following reason \"If a spy observes a bitcoin core node rebroadcasting a transaction, it would not longer know that the node has wallet enabled\" among others. I believe we agree this assumption is function of *node* rebroadcasting module being activated by default.\r\n\r\nHowever, and that's my point, a lot of full-nodes are hosting Bitcoin applications with custom rebroadcast logic, and this trend is likely to increase in the future. So those full-nodes operators, with custom rebroadcast logics and not using the bitcoin core wallet, won't be incentivized to activate by default *node* rebroadcasting as it doesn't enhance privacy of their transactions. For this reason, improvement of Bitcoin Core wallet rebroadcast privacy as alleged by this work might reveal a tight upper bound in the future, under our optimistic intuitions. To be more concrete, if only 5% of node operators activate the node rebroadcast module, it won't offer the same level of rebroadcast privacy that if it's activated on 80% of the network IMHO.\r\n\r\nI believe we should address this concern before to propose default activation of this module in the future, or at least gauge bandwidth increases are insignificant to be borne by default. I'll try to run the patch soon to help there :)\r\n\r\nAgain, as I noticed in my previous comment, this work is of course a valuable privacy improvement for Bitcoin Core wallet users, or any Bitcoin software with the same rebroadcast strategy.\r\n\r\n> I also don't understand why you say that m_attempt_tracker is creating an anonymity set- it mostly serves as a way to mitigate frequently rebroadcasting any particular transaction, not the technique we use to identify rebroadcasts.\r\n\r\nIIUC, a transaction is selected for rebroadcast if it passes block min feerate, reattempt interval and max reattempt count. However those 2 late checks aren't applied if the transaction isn't a rebroadcast entry. So `m_attempt_tracker` and its content is part of the logic determining the rebroadcast set. From an attacker viewpoint, this rebroadcast set constitutes an anonymity set. Yes `m_attempt_tracker` isn't a technique to identify rebroadcast but it's used to filter them. Though I agree, for clarify of conversation, it would have been easier to employ as a term node rebroadcast logic.\r\n\r\n> I agree that there are many possibilities & that it would be beneficial to have a more specific breakdown of privacy assumptions & guarantees. However, I don't think that we should gate concrete improvements on theoretically infinite problem spaces. I believe that the changes proposed in this PR & the intended direction of this project offer concrete, auditable improvements to privacy around 3rd parties deducing the source wallet of a transaction.\r\n\r\nAnd I share the same feeling, we would be better off not traversing an infinite problem space. Though, unless you propose an efficient problem space traversal algorithm, we're left with raising and proceeding problem if _relevant_ one by one :/ FYI, IETF does have such design questions checklist about Internet protocols (see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3426.html), though ofc not suiting per se Bitcoin space. Otherwise, I would recall that this project history showed us \"concrete improvements\" not solving the privacy issues alleged while introducing subtle DoS issues (e.g bloom filters)",

    "body": "I've been simulating the behavior of this logic using historical transaction and block data, and I have some general concept thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) In a situation where a transaction propagated reasonably well, it doesn't make sense that the whole network should simultaneously try to rebroadcast that transaction at the same time.  That is needlessly bandwidth-wasteful, as it results in an INV for that transaction to be re-sent on every link in the network, in a situation where (by assumption) few nodes would be missing it.\r\n\r\n2) In a situation where a transaction didn't propagate well or has dropped out of many nodes' mempools, but would propagate well if rebroadcast, it should be sufficient for a single node or a small number of nodes to do the rebroadcasting. \r\n\r\n3) The benefit of rebroadcasting a transaction that wouldn't propagate well seems small.  The goal is to get good transactions into miners' mempools, but if a transaction doesn't propagate well to node mempools, it probably wouldn't make it into a lot of miners' mempools either.\r\n\r\n4) I think we want to avoid bandwidth spikes on the network -- particularly right after a new block is found, when we would ideally be prioritizing bandwidth for block relay.  So it seems better to me to (a) not have all nodes on the network synchronizing on rebroadcasting simultaneously and (b) not have block connection be a trigger for rebroadcast. \r\n\r\n5) If a bunch of nodes on the network are simultaneously deciding to rebroadcast a large set of transactions, the rate-limiting we have on transaction announcements will mean that the network's transaction relay latency will go up as it takes time for the backlog to clear.  So, I think in general we should want to avoid situations where a node might want to broadcast (for example) several hundred transactions at once -- even more so if all the nodes on the network would decide to do the same thing at the same time.  This is another reason for not synchronizing rebroadcast across nodes, and I think it is also an argument for capping the number of transactions that might get selected for rebroadcasting at any particular time.\r\n\r\n6) There's little value in rebroadcasting transactions whose feerates are only slightly better than other transactions in the mempool.  Not to say we should never do it, but in thinking about the cost/benefit of transaction rebroadcast, it seems to me that prioritizing bandwidth usage on the most comparatively valuable transactions makes the most sense.  \r\n\r\nTaking the above into account, I'd propose this approach:\r\n\r\na) Any given node should rebroadcast way less often -- perhaps each node could attempt to rebroadcast on the order of once every 24 hours or every 48 hours on average, whether on a poisson timer or a random offset.  In a network with 10k listening nodes this is already a lot of rebroadcasting (10,000 / (24*60) is about 7 such nodes attempting rebroadcast every minute, not even taking into account the non-listening nodes on the network which will also be doing this!).  \r\n\r\nb) If we do (a) then we've probably greatly mitigated bandwidth spikes on the network, but I'd go further and limit the number of transactions that are ever selected to be rebroadcast at some small value like 25 or 50, to ensure we don't ever try to re-announce several hundred (or more) transactions onto the network at once.  \r\n\r\nc) I think the logic in this PR could use some refining to avoid edge-case behavior when we might rebroadcast a lot of transactions that are not valuable to rebroadcast.  These first two are cases that I've seen so far in my simulations, and the last one is a conjecture: \r\n * If a node comes back online after being offline for a while, then using block connections to trigger rebroadcast can result in rapid-fire rebroadcast of transactions that we really shouldn't be reannouncing (because both our mempool and our tip are not up to date).  I think this would be fixed by adopting (a) and (b) above.\r\n *  The mining heuristic of calling `CreateNewBlock` with an option for excluding recent transactions can result in us deciding to rebroadcast a lot of transactions that we wouldn't even select for a new block. Imagine that the mempool has just less than 1MB (vsize) of high feerate stuff that is all recent, and everything else is some uniform low feerate.  Then our cached feerate for inclusion in a block might be the low feerate (if at least 1 such transaction would be included in the block), and the heuristic of calling `CNB` with the cached feerate and excluding recent transactions can pick up thousands of low-feerate old stuff that wouldn't all realistically make it in to a new block.\r\n *  I think that reannouncing transactions that are part of a package (ie have more than 1 unconfirmed ancestor) may not be a great idea, because there are at least two reasons that packages might not relay well: (a) if any unconfirmed parent has a feerate below a peer's mempool-min-fee, then the package won't be accepted, and (b) descendant transaction limits on unconfirmed parents can interfere with relay of even a high-fee-rate child.  So to avoid wasting bandwidth, I think there's an argument that perhaps we should start by just relaying transactions with no unconfirmed parents in our initial deployment of this logic, and defer trying to relay transactions with unconfirmed ancestors until we have a package relay protocol deployed.  \r\n\r\nd) Given the issue described above with `CreateNewBlock` and the issues I am conjecturing with package relay, I suggest that we simplify the logic by eliminating the dependency on the mining algorithm, and instead just do a really simple algorithm for deciding what to consider rebroadcasting.  Randomly once a day (or maybe once every two days):\r\n * Walk the mempool by descending ancestor-fee-rate\r\n * If in the first 1MB (by vsize) of size-with-ancestor we encounter a transaction that is > 30 minutes old and has no unconfirmed parents (and hasn't hit our max number of rebroadcast attempts), then add to the rebroadcast set.\r\n * If we we hit 1MB of vsize that we've looked at or hit some cap on the number of transactions to rebroadcast (say 25), break and announce whatever we've picked so far.\r\nOne thing I'm not sure about is if we should be concerned about rebroadcasting a transaction that is close to the end of our `-mempoolexpiry` value; it seems like it could be problematic if we rebroadcast some low-feerate transaction that would otherwise be expiring soon and somehow cause it to ping-pong into other's mempools again, and then others cause it to get resurrected in our own.  Maybe we should only rebroadcast transactions that are signaling BIP 125 RBF?\r\n\r\ne) I think that we should only rebroadcast transactions to peers that are using wtxidrelay (BIP 339).  Bitcoin Core software that predates wtxidrelay will not cache validation failure for segwit transactions that don't make it into the mempool. This means that if a transaction doesn't propagate for some random policy reason (eg feerate), then the peer would still try download it from every connection that announces it.  As this PR is drafted now, where all nodes are on the same announcement timer, that means a lot of wasted *transaction download* bandwidth (not just wasted INV bandwidth!) whenever a transaction that doesn't get accepted is rebroadcast.  This would be mitigated by randomizing rebroadcasts and reducing the frequency, but I think we might as well just limit this to wtxidrelay peers as well for an extra safety margin.\r\n\r\nMy simulations of this PR on historical data are still ongoing and I don't have a good summary yet, but please let me know if there are statistics or other specific questions that would be helpful for us to consider (I have a few ideas in mind but I'm still gathering my thoughts).",

    "body": "I had one other thought about how we select transactions for rebroadcast; I think it could be problematic to base transaction rebroadcast solely on how transactions in our mempool compare to transactions that we would select in `CreateNewBlock` without regard to what transaction fees we're actually seeing in blocks on the network.\r\n\r\nImagine that you are running a somewhat older node, and there have been releases of Bitcoin Core that enable new standard transaction types that others are using.  Then your node will not be aware of those new transactions, and it's possible that only looking at the set of transactions that you know to be standard would result in rebroadcasting transactions from your mempool that are actually quite a bit below the feerate that the rest of the network thinks is needed to be confirmed soon.\r\n\r\n(Or really there could be any reason that miners might have access to better feerate transactions than a single node does -- there's still no point in aggressively rebroadcasting transactions that are worse than what we see are being confirmed.)\r\n\r\nThis problem would also be largely mitigated by making this behavior occur much less frequently and limiting the number of transactions that we'd consider rebroadcasting at once, but I think the heuristic of calling `CreateNewBlock` every minute and caching the lowest observed package feerate may be inferior to just looking at the contents of each block we see, and trying to infer the lowest feerate that we think is actually needed to be included in a block (perhaps we could look at the set of in-block transactions that have no ancestors or descendants, and try to estimate the minimum feerate needed for inclusion as a moving average of what we've recently observed -- would need to test out any kind of heuristic like this though).",

Removing these entries from `m_attempt_tracker` would  add unnecessary complexity for a small benefit of a little saved memory as far as I understand. On that note, would perhaps removing the 90 days limit and just keeping the 500 limit still be fine?",

I don't think it makes sense for this to be a configurable value, both because of what sipa highlighted here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061#issuecomment-806284509, as well as the fact that it would increase the complexity of reasoning about & maintenance burden. However, that said, I don't think of this value (30min) as set in stone- through the review process & running the patch, we should identify if this value is appropriate. Another thing to keep in mind is that any rebroadcast candidates will have to pass through `filterInventoryKnown` for an inv to be sent to the peer. \r\n",

I haven't thought this through in great depth, so let me know if I'm missing some reasons why we should consider randomizing.\r\n\r\nRE configurable: \r\nas sipa mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21061#issuecomment-806284509, \"generally the criterion for deciding whether a parameter should be configurable is whether you can also give advice under which cases users should be changing it, and how.\" I am also sensitive to introducing configurable params because it increases the maintenance burden of the project essentially forever. Do you see use cases of how you would recommend users to adjust the attempt tracker? The main reason I'd imagine for wanting a larger tracker is to reduce bandwidth, but in that case I think a \"turn rebroadcast off\" toggle would make more sense (and of this PR its off by default) ",

The only event that has the ability to decrease the top-of-mempool fee rate is a block being mined. Otherwise, as transactions enter the mempool, the top-of-mempool fee rate either stays the same or increases. \r\n\r\nIf the top-of-mempool fee rate is only increasing over time, the fee rate cache would not help filter any transactions out. \r\n\r\nOur desired order is: cache | block | rebroadcast, with the delta between cache & block to be as small as possible. \r\n\r\nThe order we want to skip is: block | cache | rebroadcast, because then the fee rate filter will be meaningless, and would simply select the _next highest_ transactions to rebroadcast (which we logically wouldn't expect to be mined yet). \r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Does the update to the comment help clarify? I'm not sure the best way to capture this in the code, so open to suggestions. ",

    "body": "IIUC the purpose of this variable, we assume miners's mempools to be composed in average of 1/4 of _irreplaceable_ transactions. I.e transactions even if we know better feerate candidates, we won't be able to replace them as their scores are unduly increased by miner's mempool policy.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, this sounds a lot, do you have any real-world data backing up this assumption ? One could look on how many mined block transactions are under the local node `MinTxFeeRate` you've introduced to determine the size of the _surprise_ set.\r\n\r\nWhat's the trade-off of picking a value deviating from real-world data ? Well I think you may prevent or delay rebroadcast of transactions in the bottom quarter of block feerate. Due to this delay, broadcasting clients of those transactions may reach a fee-bumping timer and they trigger a RBF/CPFP in consequence. As such bleeding feerate beyond what would have been effective to get into block templates.\r\n\r\nIf the risk I'm describing is founded, do you think we should preserve transactions broadcaster's feerate instead of network nodes' bandwidth ? I'm leaning toward a yes as rebroadcast logic is at least opt-in, but broadcaster won't be aware of their peers's policies barring propagation of their good-enough feerate transaction.",

    "body": "Let's say an attacker partitions a victim's mempool from the rest of network mempools thanks to maliciously conflicting transactions. E.g send non-rbf signaling, _differing_ transactions to victim and all its tx-relay connected peers. \r\n\r\nThose malicious transactions are attached a feerate high-enough to completely occupy the `m_attempt_tracker`. Due to `MIN_REATTEMPT_INTERVAL`=4h and assuming 6 blocks per hour, it will require 6 * 4 * 500 = 12000 transactions to jam victim's rebroadcast attempt. Of course, `MAX_REBROADCAST_COUNT` should upper bound such behavior, but an attacker can easily renew `m_attempt_tracker` jamming by RBFing the pinning transactions.\r\n\r\nLet's assume malicious transactions size is `MIN_STANDARD_TX_NONWITNESS_SIZE`, so 82 bytes. Let's assume top block feerate is 170 sat/vbyte. Shrugging at RBF replacement fee penalties, 12_000 * 82 * 170 = 167_280_000 sats. So a permanent `m_attempt_tracker` jamming would require 1,67 BTC available to the attacker, though not burnt if the mempool isolation is operated properly.\r\n\r\nDo the attack model seems sound to you ? If so I think we should carefully document risks of `m_attempt_tracker` pinning and likely scale up parameters value.",

If yes I agree that's not that much and I think we're relieved on this concern :) If it does causes issues on low-grade nodes in the future, due to non-linear scaling of the CPU time in function of mempool size, I guess we'll be able to make this value configurable, offering a trade-off between CPU and bandwidth to node operators.\r\n\r\n> its a pretty critical component to this approach, without it the node would most likely be attempting to rebroadcast MAX_REBROADCAST_WEIGHT of transactions on every block.\r\n\r\nDo you mean without it or with a lower frequency rather than 1 min ? IIUC, the node would attempt to rebroadcast `MAX_REBROADCAST_WEIGHT` because you don't account for the fresh arrivals of new transactions. The feerate of those newcomers making most of your rebroadcast candidates irrelevant to block confirmation ? If refreshing the cache was costly, I guess we would run it once between _expected_ block intervals when the odds of having discovered enough new transactions to have a consistent view of next block are high. But cost is pretty low, so I don't think we care further... \r\n\r\nnit: maybe replace 1 by a named constant like `CACHE_REBROADCAST_FEERATE_FREQUENCY` ?",

It is essentially used to say \"if a transaction hasn't been selected for rebroadcast in the past 3 months, remove it from the attempt tracker\"\r\n\r\n> Let's say in optimistic scenarios, a rebroadcast entry has a compelling feerate enough to be selected by GetRebroadcastTransactions after each MIN_REATTEMPT_INTERVAL, after 6 * 4, it's matured enough to be legitimately expired ?\r\n\r\ncan you clarify what you mean by \"legitimately expired\"? if you mean that we should disable automatic rebroadcast so the txn can (probably) expire from the (majority of) network mempools, then yes I agree. which is why we put it on the tracker. but then, what is the question? \r\n\r\n>  select MEMPOOL_EXPIRY as a maximum age.\r\n\r\nif we stored transactions on the attempt tracker for the same duration as `MEMPOOL_EXPIRY` time, that would leave room for the issue that the attempt tracker is meant to address. for more explanation on that, please see https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin-notes/blob/main/rebroadcast-history.md#faq section \"What happens if a transaction can / will never be mined?\". expiry would be one of the main ways to get the ping-ponging behavior for never-going-to-be-mined transactions (eg. due to a policy upgrade on the network).",

    "body": "Thanks for the second clarifying update, effectively this is documented L124 in `src/txrebroadcast.cpp`, \"No existing entry, we will rebroadcast, so create new one\". \r\n\r\nSo IIUC, even if `m_attempt_tracker` is fulfilled with pinning transactions, it won't block node rebroadcast capability. I think pinning costs of `m_attempt_tracker` above roughly above but it can't be abused by an attacker to jam rebroadcasting, so we're good.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to document this \"pinning-doesn't-block-rebroadcast-so-not-a-new-tx-relay jamming-vector\" around `m_attempt_tracker` declaration in `src/txreconciliation.h`, it's quite an important design aspect imo.\r\n\r\nW.r.t to asymmetric bandwidth usage and risks of bleeding, I don't think `m_attempt_tracker` pinning is making it better or worst, I share the opinion we're ultimately protected by `filterInventoryKnown`.\r\n\r\n>  I don't understand how the attacker avoids spending any funds- say A and A' are two versions of the same txn via RBF. A is sent to the victim & A' is sent to the rest of the network. according to the current patch, if A' gets mined into a block, A is removed from the attempt tracker.\r\n\r\nI should have precise this point. Transaction A feerate to successfully pin `m_attempt_tracker` must be at 170 sat/vbyte. However transaction A' feerate just need to be above miners'mempools min feerates to block propagation of transaction A. If transaction A' feerate is 2 sat/vbyte, with same equation laid out above, effective pinning cost for an attacker is 12_000 * 82 * 2 = 1_968_000 sats and not 167_280_000 sats. Miners observe and eventually mine transactions with a far lower-feerate than the ones maliciously sent to non-miner nodes. This is what I meant by \"not burnt if the mempool isolation is operated properly\".",

    "body": "IIRC, by \"legitimately expired\" I meant a transaction of which `m_count` has reached `MAX_REBROADCAST_COUNT`. As we already rebroadcasted this transaction the maximum number of times permitted, we skip its rebroadcasting forever, but without necessarily removing it from `m_attempt_tracker` ? I think such transaction has exhausted its rebroadcast \"credit\" and it's mature enough to be \"legitimately\" expired or pruned. Though this deletion criteria isn't currently considered in `TrimMaxRebroadcast()` ? \r\n\r\nI think this deletion criteria would be more efficient to expire transactions from the majority of network mempools rather than MAX_ENTRY_AGE, especially with a 3 months delay.\r\n\r\n> if we stored transactions on the attempt tracker for the same duration as MEMPOOL_EXPIRY time, that would leave room for the issue that the attempt tracker is meant to address. for more explanation on that, please see https://github.com/amitiuttarwar/bitcoin-notes/blob/main/rebroadcast-history.md#faq section \"What happens if a transaction can / will never be mined?\". expiry would be one of the main ways to get the ping-ponging behavior for never-going-to-be-mined transactions (eg. due to a policy upgrade on the network)\r\n\r\nIIUC, the problem we're trying to solve is \"How to avoid never-going-to-be-mined transactions to forever ping-pong across the network ?\". \r\n\r\nTo achieve this aim, I believe we should expire a rebroadcast entry as soon as it has exhausted its rebroadcast count, a hint that either feerate is definitively aloof or severer circumstances as described in documentation. But selecting a MAX_ENTRY_AGE superior to MEMPOOL_EXPIRY moves in the opposite direction. \r\n\r\nIf rebroadcast entry _average_ rebroadcast interval  is superior to 56 hours, 56 * MAX_REBROADCAST_COUNT== MEMPOOL_EXPIRY and node rebroadcast guarantees attempts beyond the mempool expiration limit ?\r\n\r\nOr is the behavior I'm describing not possible ? I'm happy to illustrate with a test to assert our intuitions :)\r\n\r\nupdate: Or is the purpose of keeping rebroadcast entry with `m_count` == `MAX_REBROADCAST_COUNT` and only expire them when `last_attempt` is older than MAX_ENTRY_AGE prevent new registration in `m_attempt_tracker` cache provoked by rebroadcast from other network mempools ? Thus you expect a transaction to expire from mempools after MEMPOOL_EXPIRY, then to avoid network laggards with differing policy to trigger new rebroadcasting wawes, you have MAX_ENTRY_AGE as an upper bound of MEMPOOL_EXPIRY ? \r\n\r\nOkay I can see how it solves mempool ping-pong though reasoning could be better documented and still we should envisage to reduce MAX_ENTRY_AGE to minimize node fingerprinting.",

More generally there is also the fact that the bip125 replacement penalty is static (DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE) is _static_ and doesn't scale up in function of your mempool congestion.\r\n\r\nSimplify fee-bumping algorithms a lot though at the price of bandwidth overcost for network nodes processing replacement...\r\n\r\nW.r.t to `filterInventoryKnown`, a malicious roll over isn't new from introducing node rebroadcast logic, though from now this module make assumptions on it to prevent bandwidth bleeding.",

    "body": "It seems to me that `m_attempt_tracker` has two distinct purposes:\r\n\r\n1. prevent us from rebroadcasting transactions too frequently (see `entry_it->m_last_attempt > start_time - MIN_REATTEMPT_INTERVAL`)\r\n2. prevent us from rebroadcasting transactions too many times (see `else if (entry_it->m_count >= MAX_REBROADCAST_COUNT)`)\r\n\r\nI think the expiry strategies conflict for these two purposes. Imagine that we (unupgraded) have 550 txs that are no longer standard for the rest of the network\r\n\r\n- for don't-rebroadcast-too-frequently, we want to expire least-recently-rebroadcast first, since if we expire more recently rebroadcast transactions, then we'll try to rebroadcast them again the next time we receive a block, and we'll end up rebroadcasting a very small set of txs very frequently.\r\n- for don't-rebroadcast-too-many-times, if we expire the least-recently-rebroadcast first, then the next time we calculate a rebroadcast set, we'll include them again, re-add them to attempt_tracker, and expire the next oldest 50. We'll continue cycling all the now-nonstandard transactions through the attempt tracker over and over again.\r\n\r\nI think it might be a good idea to separate these two purposes by adding a (rolling?) bloom filter for (2). Once a transaction has been rebroadcast `MIN_REATTEMPT_INTERVAL` times (or it's removed from the attempt tracker because the tracker is full) we toss it in the bloom filter and then never rebroadcast it again (at least until restart).",

IIRC it's preferable to pass `uint256` by reference to const rather than by value, e.g. `const uint256& txid{tx->GetHash()};` or `const auto& txid = tx->GetHash();` (and here these aliases may as well be const anyway as IIUC they aren't intended to be mutated). It looks like there are a few other places.",

Why is a new `BlockAssembler::MinTxFeeRate()` function created instead of using `CBlockPolicyEstimator::estimateSmartFee()` with a confirmation target of 1 block or some implementation built using the fee estimator? I'm not too familiar with how it works, but it seems like a very similar idea - get an estimation of what fee would be needed to make it into the next block.",

    "body": "yeah, I went through a similar thought process. In the initial pass, I opted for the `ReadBlockFromDisk` approach because it seemed simpler. But in the latest push, I updated the `UpdateBlockTip` function signature to also take in `block`. Unfortunately, it seems like callers cannot rely on `block` to be properly populated, so I still need to have the `ReadBlockFromDisk` as a fallback. The relevant code is in 33eb966d284bd954af16ed5905315e0bc91c3662 & 33eb966d284bd954af16ed5905315e0bc91c3662, let me know what you think.",

I think this can result in the mempool containing txs with fee rates of: `120 s/vb, 119 s/vb, 118 s/vb, 117 s/vb, 115 s/vb, 110 s/vb, 105 s/vb, 100 s/vb, 95 s/vb, 80 s/vb, 79 s/vb, ...` and the block containing txs with fee rates of: `120, 119, 118, 117, 95, 80` -- because the 110-100 s/vb txs just didn't fit in the block, but the 95 and 80 s/vb txs happened to be tiny. This would then incorrectly result in txs with fee rates above 80 s/vb being rebroadcast, whereas really only txs with fee rates above 117 s/vb should be.",
