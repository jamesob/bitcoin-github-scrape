    "body": "Thank you for the review - one thing (general design related) to add to the discussion here:\r\n\r\nSince I've submitted this request - I happened to stumble upon two race conditions in validation that stem from concurrent calls to ProcessNewBlock (#12988, #13023) \r\nThis pr should simplify the concurrency model for block validation (a single validation thread pulls a block to validate from the queue and validates it completely before moving on to the next block) and would have inadvertently fixed those two referenced race conditions.\r\n\r\nExplicitly simplifying the concurrency model hopefully reduces a bit the cognitive burden of future code changes in validation and I don't think makes anything substantially less efficient - much of validation is already single threaded (because of cs_main), and certain pieces fundamentally cannot be concurrent (i.e. connecttip). Validation is already complicated enough to understand on its own without worrying about concurrency.\r\n\r\nSeems like the clarity gains will outweigh the minor efficiency hit here - +the async api into should allow all the stuff around validation to be more easily be parallelized with less risk of inadvertently introducing a consensus bug. And it makes process separation / alternate p2p more natural if that's ever to be a thing in the future.\r\n\r\nIf this design seems useful - my intention is to finish this pr up (some stuff around compact blocks that I still have to work through + refit the couple of places in rpc that call ProcessNewBlock) and explore subsequent prs to put a similar model in place around the mempool. I'd also like to explore feasibility for header processing.",

    "body": "I do think the general approach is fine. It's not going to be really at all useful until we do a ton of locking cleanups in net_processing (it'll let us run ahead to the next message, which almost always requires cs_main, and we'll end up blocking on validation anyway). It's probably simpler than multiple net_processing threads (with the same cleanups required) which was most of my previous work, but they'll end up looking pretty similar on the net_processing end, we were gonna need this blocking-on-response logic either way. Should definitely get brought up at a meeting, though, to get wider feedback. @theuni probably has some thoughts, too.",

I didn't want to poke through the queue api just to enable shutdown - you'd have to have `T Pop()` potentially not return a `T` (i.e. throw an exception) - which seemed less desirable and maybe equally complicated.\r\n\r\nHaving said that - a lot of the complexity here is introduced to handle:\r\n- being able to shutdown a specific ConsumerThread without shutting down others (in reality you probably only ever want to shut down all of them when you terminate the process)\r\n- allowing for a queue with fewer slots than the number of threads servicing it (unlikely)\r\n\r\nOnly reason I allowed for these is so that the APIs to the queue work the way they sound like they should work and for unit test completeness. If I discard the above the code gets much simpler and it will just be broken for two use cases that seem pretty unlikely to ever happen right now (but you never know - and then maybe somebody gets frustrated one day).",

Advantages to dropping these template arguments:\r\n\r\n1) Readability. It would be nice to be able to see if a push or pop call is blocking just by looking at the call, without have to check another part of the code to see how the queue data structure was initially declared.\r\n2) Code size. Dropping these arguments would avoid compiler potentially having to instantiate many copies of this code for different combinations of template arguments.\r\n3) Extensibility. There could be other useful blocking methods added in the future (like methods to wait for low/high water marks or for empty/full events) and it would either be verbose to have to add new classwide blocking/nonblocking defaults for new methods, or confusing to have to somehow tie existing defaults to new methods.\r\n4) Consistency. If you look at other C++ objects that support optional blocking like std::mutex or std::future, the blocking behaviour is determined only by the particular method call, not by template arguments from where the object was declared.",

I think this would make code using the queue easier to understand, since blocking would be explicit, instead of based on an enum value determined by a combination of method argument, class template argument, method argument default, and class template argument default values. It could also make code using the queue easier to write, since there would no longer be any chance of hitting various compile and runtime checks for invalid enum values.\r\n\r\nI do understand the enum is useful in tests for listing all possible combinations of behavior, but for that purpose, you could just define the enum in test code.",

    "body": "This thing is pretty complex, and right now it looks like we don't do granular per-thread per-queue shutdowns. The only instance of this being used is shutting down the single thread associated with ValidationQueue. When would a situation arise where we need to shut off some but not all of the threads consuming from a queue? I can't think of a case where that'd be necessary.\r\n\r\nCould we just have the queue itself raise a shutdown signal for the threads? Have `queue->Pop()` return (or set) a sentinel shutdown value of some kind instead? Might save a good bit of code, and would remove the need for some of the locking in ConsumerThread.",

If you make blocking an attribute of push/pop methods rather than an attibutes of the queue you can drop the consumer/producer terminology, which I'm finding confusing now that I'm looking at downstream code. E.g. if I push an item into the queue, that seems like producing from my perspective, but it's consuming from the queue/worker thread perspective and makes that code a bit strange, IMO.",

Could you maybe note this in a short comment to avoid confusion? Alternately it might be clearer just to use `ProducerConsumerQueue` directly, and not have `BlockingConsumerQueue` as a thing.\r\n\r\nTBH, also, I don't actually understand why PRODUCER_MODE exists as a parameter. Why would code constructing WorkQueue want to control the default consumer mode of the queue when it doesn't consume from the queue (ConsumerThread does)?",

Even if you want to support shutting down specific threads, an approach more like \"Everybody wake up, check if you are supposed to exit, and if not go back to sleep again\" might be simpler than \"Random thread wake up, check if you are supposed to exit, and if not wake up another random thread, but not if you already seen this particular notification before,\" or whatever the correct description is. (If you do want to stick with the current approach, it could be nice to add a high level comment explaining it like this.)",
