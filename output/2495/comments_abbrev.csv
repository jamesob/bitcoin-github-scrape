laanwj,2013-04-12T03:44:47Z,"Code-wise, I would prefer if you move this stuff to a function or class. The main is already pretty cluttered.

jonasschnelli,2013-04-12T08:43:56Z,"the testnet will be cut of the string, but further down you will see a part of code who places a ""[testnet]"" string if testnet is on in the upper right corner.
