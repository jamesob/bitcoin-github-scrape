    "body": "@luke-jr   You could go hog wild with multiple choices,  >X, >Y, >Z second old.. but if its tuned right it should pretty much always be choosing to exclude recent transactions, and the other alternative is just so that you don't regret your decisions when some bozo sends a very high fee transaction.   The marginal gain from more options is going to be pretty small compared to the block creation delay from the CPU costs in considering more options-- and what you'll be mining on instead.  E.g. spending another 10ms mining on an empty block is probably not worth whatever gain you could have in considering another recentness level.\r\n\r\nIt's also the case that block propagation performance between miners is probably pretty consistent and narrowly spread... meaning that either you made a block that could get everywhere with 0-rtt or you didn't-- and there probably isn't a lot of space in-between.   So I think thats what this is modeling: the no-recent alternative will make it ~everywhere with no round trips, and the other one is going to take a round trip-- so you only want it if it pays enough more to justify the increased orphan risk.\r\n",

Either you'll include recent transactions too often because your criteria is too loose, or if your criteria is tighter, you risk giving up too much fee income if network conditions change.",

If I remember right, I think he suggested that we could just keep a cache of the last block generated in the BlockAssembler, and when a new call to CNB is made, after we addPackages, but before we call TBV, check to see if this criteria for recent transactions has been met -- if not, return the old template and skip the TBV call.\r\n\r\nThis should speed up calls to CreateNewBlock substantially (most of the time spent is in TestBlockValidity), and provide the benefit of only including recent transactions when its economically beneficial, with a relatively small code change.  \r\n\r\nI think we'd also reduce the window on the cache that already exists in getblocktemplate.",

But if the `noRecent` block currently includes these ancestor transactions, then why set their fees to 0 here?",

    "body": "FYI I've reworked this code in the latest version, combining the removal of transactions and updating `mapModifiedTx`, as this was needlessly inefficient (with an extra call to `CalculateDescendants`).\r\n\r\nBut to answer your question: `mapModifiedTx` contains transactions that are not in the constructed block which have ancestors that are in the block.  When we remove a transaction from the block, we need to remove any in-block descendants (which won't be in `mapModifiedTx`), but we need to update the ancestor feerate score for the entries in `mapModifiedTx`, so that the packages are properly sorted.\r\n\r\nSince we generally should never select those transactions on the next call to `addPackageTxs` (outside of reorg situations, the arrival time of a descendant should be later than the arrival time of the parent), it might be better to just remove those descendants from `mapModifiedTx` rather than correct the package information, but I think its simpler to reason about the code if `mapModifiedTx` is always sorted correctly.",

    "body": "Yeah that's worth explaining.  The issue was that if you got unlucky you might find a transaction with, eg, 2 ancestors, one in the block and one not in the block.  Then the ancestor feerate stats for the child tx would not be correct for determining how much to fee bump (eg you might be including some higher feerate parent in the calculation!) which could cause the test to fail.\r\n\r\nBy requiring that we look for a transaction with exactly one not-in-block parent, we can exclude edge cases where other transactions might affect the package feerate used in CNB.",
