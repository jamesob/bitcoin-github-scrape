    "body": "No, it doesn't get computed wrongly. The underlying (psychological) issue is that the progress bar makes the sync look like a normal linear download of a fixed-size file in the mind of users. Adding a percentage adds to this illusion.\n\nEven though in reality it fetches a growing tree structure of uncertain (at least to any one observer) size, of which only the longest path is significant.\n\nSo there is a cognitive gap, and I would applaud efforts to visualize the progress in an intuitive way that doesn't cause this inherent confusion. However this is likely much more complex than can be solved by hair splitting over whether to show a percentage or not, or where to start counting.\n\nQuite possibly effort is better spent solving the underlying issue that frustrates users: having to wait at all! For example, developers are working on making the client start in SPV mode, so it is immediately usable, then fetching the block chain in the background.\n",

But if it's more than that (10 blocks, 50 blocks, 500 blocks...) then putting up the progress bar and starting from empty again is more what a user would expect, IMHO (I know it's what I would expect). I know the 100% point is unpredictable and there will be cases where the bar fills up all the way, then has to change to a valueless active state, but it's still better than throwing up a bar that always looks like it's a pixel short of being full, every time.\n",

IMHO, it just shows that a progress bar is not the correct way to represent this information. Current git head shows \"N days behind\" for example, instead of a percentage, which is certainly more useful. It also bases the progress calculation on the number of (estimated) transactions, rather than the number of blocks (which is very fast initially, and very slow at the end).\n",
