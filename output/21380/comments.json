    "body": "~Because of the refactoring this will conflict heavily with other changes to versionbits. I've rebased #21377 on top of this and there's a height based variant at #21392.~ I think it should be possible to adapt to cover the rest of #19573, but haven't tried. It would require some refactoring of the bip8 code in order to be able to catch bugs in the MUST_SIGNAL handling, but maybe that's worthwhile anyway.\r\n\r\nParticularly interested in additional checks that could be added, or better ways of converting fuzz data into interesting chains to test. I've just hardcoded the intervals at 10 minutes, ~and currently the BIP9 timeouts will precisely match some block's time, which could be missing edge cases?~ So far it seems pretty reasonable though.",

Also, `ConsumeBool` would leave open the possibility to use the data provider afterwards without invalidating the inputs.",

    "body": "@JeremyRubin on #21377 wrote:\r\n\r\n> @MarcoFalke's comment is a slight misunderstanding I believe of how the fuzzer simulates time; I recall AJ saying (somewhere) that block times are steady interval in the fuzzing so that it doesn't matter (can't find that comment now tho). Is that correct?\r\n\r\nThe fuzzer picks the mtp parameters for the deployment by first picking a random block (`start_block` or `end_block`), figuring out the timestamp that block will have (same formula as `Blocks::mine_block` use for `nTime`), and then randomly bumps one or the other by half the interval, just to check it's not relying on exact equality.\r\n\r\n(So switching fuzzing from mtp to height should just be a matter of using `start_block` and `end_block` directly)\r\n\r\nThe steady interval means there's no direct testing of what happens if blocks happen to come really quickly or really slowly, however if the fuzzer picks two blocks in the same period for start/timeout, that should pretty much simulate the same behaviour.",

A time-scale of 10 seconds is nothing compared to the CPU time that is going to be spent on this in our fuzz farms. I think the primary thing to optimize is to write tests in a way they are easy to understand and hard to get wrong when modified/written. For example, in another test (commit fa42da2d5424c0aeccfae4b49fde2bea330b63dc) a fully consumed buffer has already bitten me.",
