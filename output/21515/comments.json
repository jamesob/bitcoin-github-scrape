    "body": "Maybe this is an \"the emperor has no clothes moment\", but I shall say what's on my mind without fear of appearing stupid.\r\n\r\nTo me, this change looks like the improvements are simply due to reducing the delay between sending TXs. With this change I see greater bandwidth, greater TX throughput but reduced efficiency (i.e. percentage of useful bandwidth). I've been seeing this since I started testing months ago.\r\n\r\nFor example, there's a node in Toronto currently that is managing to be the main provider of TXs, and is not using erlay. I suspect they have changed the code to reduce the delay between TXs:-\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1530283/133979106-690e62c1-c724-4022-9b69-66fb57dc9f3f.png)\r\n\r\nThis seems easily achieveable without erlay. Erlay also reduces the delay between sending TXs, so it's an easy hack to get better TX throughput, but the difference with erlay is that it also reduces efficiency (in all my tests so far).\r\n\r\nErlay does well with throughput:-\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1530283/133979283-9a4b6476-c0b0-4708-a9bb-760819127954.png)\r\n\r\nbut badly with efficency:-\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1530283/133979323-39f1f1c2-0490-49a9-867d-eeceb4066c1a.png)\r\n\r\nI'd like to see some test results from others that contradict mine though.",

The case I don't get the rational for is recon_peer_flood_to=true and flood_tx=false. \r\n\r\nAFAICT, it's motivated to preserve privacy of transactions originated locally as detailed in `RelayTransaction` ? I don't think it's achieving its goal as this announcement (i.e _reconciliation_) will diverge from the announcement-protocol expected on the link (i.e _flooding_) and this is observable by the peer on the other side of the link ?\r\n\r\nOverall, yes the comment could be better as it's describing code behavior but not it's rational (or pointing where the rational is laid out). Instead, what do you think of ?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n// Unless sketch capacity has been reached, expected announcement policy should not diverge\r\n// for reconciling peers.\r\n// Outbound flooding peers may the expected announcement policy overridden in function of\r\n// the transaction source. Transactions originated locally should be always announced through\r\n// reconciliation, see RelayTransaction().\r\n\r\n``` ",

    "body": ">This case I understand. The case I don't get the rational for is recon_peer_flood_to=true and flood_tx=false.\r\n\r\nOk, what exactly are you suggesting? Always flood if `recon_peer_flood_to=true` and drop `flood_tx` at all?\r\n\r\n1. If this is applied, non-reachable nodes will flood transactions to 7 (erlay enabled) peers after receiving transactions from the 8th. No bandwidth savings because almost all transactions are flooded, bad.\r\n\r\n2. How erlay solves this? Adding a policy: \"flood only if a transaction is received from reconciliation initiator [or legacy peer]\". Now non-reachable nodes will never flood, because they have no recon initiator peers (because they have no inbounds). Assuming no legacy peers.\r\n\r\n3. Now, what to do with local transactions? If non-reachable nodes flood them, their reconciling peers will easily tell those are local transactions, because this is the only case non-reachable node floods.\r\nFor this special case, we also use reconciliation, to provide privacy.\r\n\r\n-------------------\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-------\r\n\r\nNow, I assume you can change step (2) or even step (1) here and have some different logic. Feel free to suggest, but this is my thinking for now, and Erlay is based on it. \r\n\r\nLet me know if it's clear.\r\n",

There are 2 possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Handle legacy peers as a special case, so have this accounting twice (in VERACK for legacy, in SENDRECON for reconciliation).\r\n2. Always initialize ReconciliationState with `m_flood_to=false`, and update it to true on VERACK if there are still slots (along with tracking out peers in VERACK)",

AFAICT, it's decided there without evaluating node reachability : https://github.com/naumenkogs/bitcoin/blob/5b8c65d32c142e7d91aef13772cf8c771020bee7/src/txreconciliation.cpp#L654\r\n\r\nThat said, I agree with your laid out reasoning on flooding-vs-reconciling peers selection for non-reachable nodes and how to protect their local transaction privacy. \r\n\r\nBut I don't think current code logic hinders well reachable nodes's local transactions as you will reconciliate (flood_tx=false) with your outbound flooding peers.\r\n\r\nLet me write a functional test to sustain (or not) my thinking :)",

If it's second I would recommend to replace the bumping value by RECON_RESPOND_INTERVAL, I think it can be taken verbatim from txreconciliation.cpp like you're already doing for few values.\r\n\r\nThat way you can assert that's the module is binding to the interval expectation. Otherwise, slightly increasing RECON_RESPOND_INTERVAL doesn't break the test.",
