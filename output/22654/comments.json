It's true that I e.g. do not download into a subfolder \"x86_64-linux-gnu\", so as you said, I experienced that sha256sum -c --ignore-missing does not work.\r\n\r\nMy workaround was just to do `grep <Tarballname> SHA256SUMS` and then `sha256sum <Tarballname>` to be able to do manual visual comparison of the two output hashes (which I did also with the previous SHA256SUM format file, which contained the signature itself).\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is good or bad, on one hand I like it that the SHA256SUMS file mirrors the download directory structure, that is clean and I think it would not be feasible to have an SHA256SUMS file in every arch sub dir, because that would require also a signature file for each of them. On the other hand, I agree, that normally one does not download in an arch sub dir. But the latter could be done easily I think, though.",

Updates release-notes.md to mention that we need to flatten the output hier when uploading, 2. Makes the resulting SHA256SUMS file have filenames that are `basename`-ified (no `dirname`)\r\n11:50 < gribble> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22654 | guix: Dont include directory name in SHA256SUMS by achow101 \u00b7 Pull Request #22654 \u00b7 bitcoin/bitcoin \u00b7 GitHub\r\n11:53 < dongcarl> I didn't want to touch the output dir hier for guix-build itself because looking at it it might introduce more problems that will slow down rc's and will mess up: 1. Atomicity of the mv OUTDIR ACTUAL_OUTDIR means there are no half-formed outputs 2. In the future we can more granularly bind-mount output dirs into build containers to ensure that one\r\n11:53 < dongcarl> HOST's build is physically unable to tamper with another HOST's output\r\n11:53 < laanwj> i was wondering about the atomicity-per-platform thing\r\n11:54 < laanwj> agree that that makes flattening last minute a better option\r\n```",

    "body": "I had still the ambition to understand this strange `_` \"dummy\" parameter and to find any documentation about that, but as Hebasto said, Bash manpage does not help on `_`. After some testing I think I found out now :)\r\nManpage of Bash 5.0.3 for option `-c`:\r\n\r\n> If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.\r\n> If there are arguments after the command_string,  the first argument is assigned to $0\r\n> and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.\r\n> The assignment to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not understand what the last sentence means, can anybody explain? But the text before the last sentence can be proofed with this example:\r\n```\r\nbash -c 'echo $0 $1' param1 param2\r\nparam1 param2\r\n```\r\nSo what we know from Bash scripts, that $0 is the name of the script, is not the case in bash command using `-c`. In the latter case, $0 is the first parameter, what we know from Bash scripts as $1.\r\nSo I think the `_` is only used to fill $0, so the numbering of parameters using bash command -c is the same as in bash script (first really used parameter $1 and so on).\r\nIt is not really needed.\r\nYou can just replace $1 with $0 in the bash command, then you do not need the `_` dummy parameter.\r\nSo you can write shorter and simpler this:\r\n`find \"$GIT_ARCHIVE\" \"$ACTUAL_OUTDIR\" -type f -execdir bash -c 'basename \"$0\" | xargs sha256sum' {} \\; \\`\r\nShellcheck is also happy with this.\r\nI would suggest this, as it is simpler and shorter and less confusing. There is only need to explain that with `-c` what one normally knows as $1 becomes $0 there.\r\nA comment to explain the parameter numbering shift is needed anyway I think, be it using the `_` dummy parameter or not. So one can comment like this:\r\n\r\n`Unlike in Bash scripts, the first parameter to bash -c <command> is assigned to $0, not $1`\r\n\r\nI updated the shellcheck [wiki page](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2156) to remove the confusing dummy parameter usage.\r\n\r\nEdit: In any case, the name \"_\" for the first dummy parameter is unluckily chosen, it should better be \"dollarzero\" or \"dummy\" or \"foobar\" or something like that to avoid confusion with bash variable `$_` etc.",

I guess \"_\" is beside it's mistakability also not a good name for the shell in error message.\r\n\r\nA possibility would be to set the first shell command parameter to the value of the executed shell, e.g.\r\n```\r\n# For Bash:\r\n$ bash -c 'provoke_error ; echo $1 $2' bash a b\r\nbash: provoke_error: command not found\r\na b\r\n\r\n# For Dash:\r\n$ dash -c 'provoke_error ; echo $1 $2' dash a b\r\ndash: 1: dash: provoke_error: not found\r\na b\r\n```",
