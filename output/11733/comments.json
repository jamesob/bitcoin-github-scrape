    "body": "@fanquake Thanks for reviewing. Good point. Would it be possible to state that locking requirement more explicitly using annotations (see #11226)? Perhaps one way to do it would be if the two uses were separated: `CNode* FindNode(\u2026)` would require holding `cs_vNodes` (which would be clearly stated using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`) whereas say `bool NodeExists(\u2026)` wouldn't? Worth doing?",
