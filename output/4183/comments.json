    "body": "Did some digging using git's pickaxe...\n\nACK on removing:\n- `CWallet::AddReserveKey` : Was never used at all, added by @sipa back in 2011 in 30ab2c9c\n- `CTransaction::IsNewerThan`: Was used by the transaction replacement code which was removed in 98c7c8fd\n- `LogException`: Hasn't been used for as long as Satoshi was still here\n- `LookupHostNumeric`: Is simply a wrapper for `LookupHost(_1, _2, _3, false)`, no need for this we can pass a boolean if we need this functionality.\n- `CBlockIndex::GetMedianTime`: was used in CWalletTx::GetTxTime until 471426fb3, in 2011\n\nNACK on removing:\n- `CWallet::GetDestData`: part of the *DestData API, which is planned to be used more extensively by the GUI\n- `CNetAddr::IsMulticast`: part of basic 'what is this address' functionality - though it's doubtful we will use multicast, we might want to detect these addresses for error robustness or such.\n- `CDBEnv::RemoveDb`: doubtful that we'll ever allow removing wallets - but for API symmetry it makes sense to keep this function\n- `CService::SetPort`: API symmetry, run-time configurability\n- `UnregisterWallet`: it's probably a bug that this isn't used - and will certainly be needed if someone ever implements multi-wallet support\n\nNot sure:\n- `CPubKey::VerifyCompact`: counterpart to `CKey::SignCompact` which is used, but seems that we use `RecoverCompact` instead in verifymessage()\n",
