    "body": "Continuing to support transaction priority (as defined by coin age) seems more trouble that its worth.  However, by combining this with #6357, it'll be easy and efficient to keep the existing policies in place.  I did some timing tests on the first 7 days of July and there was some small increase in the average of 250ms to connect a block.  Calling recalcPriorities took about 2ms.  In the busy spam period of July 7th, recalcPriorities was averaging about 8ms out of 500ms to connect a block.  Those seem like acceptable performance hits to me.  #6357 did not seem to adversely affect that performance and causes the priorities to actually be correct.\n\nWhere the default policies will break is when we start adding mempool eviction.  We'd need to maintain two separate maps of transactions, one for those destined to be included in the fee section and one for those to be included in the priority section of blocks and evict from them independently.  I'd argue that instead, we should accept that high priority but low fee transactions may get evicted from the mempool if we hit mempool saturation.   Alternatively we could implement @petertodd's exponentially increasing minRelayTxFee and not actually evict things.  Either way those are next steps and shouldn't hold up this getting merged.\n\nutACK at this point, I'm going to keep testing.\n",

I think we need to figure out what to do here at a higher level.\n\n1) Remain compatible with the existing priorities system. This means the recomputations of priority as implemented in this PR, and retaining the relatively complex multi-faceted block creation code. This is likely the least controversial change, but implementing correct mempool limiting becomes pretty hard.\n\n2) Simplify the priority mechanism to become single-faceted. This would mean defining a (potentially policy-dependent) single scoring function for transactions that can give a benefit to specific transactions. Something similar to priority could be implemented by mapping the \"zero-fee\" transactions onto a negative number -1/priority. A single ordered index would suffice, and mempool limiting and block creation would be simplified significantly, but re-evaluating the ordering would be necessary after every block.\n\n3) The same as (2), but only compute the policy-dependent scoring once only - when entering the mempool. You can approximate something similar to priority by counting old/large inputs as a virtual small increase in fee. It would not get updated for new blocks, simplifying code for replacement/limiting further.\n\n4) Just have a single feerate index, essentially limiting ourselves to a single mempool policy. This is arguably the most economic thing to do for miners, and has the best predictability for fee estimation. It's perhaps the most controversial change.\n\nI would prefer 2 or 3.\n",

I can see two downsides to 1.  There is some additional memory footprint and complication by maintaining correct priorities, but I think the efficiency hit is tolerable.  And the issue about defining \"correct\" mempool limiting.  However, I think that issue exists regardless of whether we maintain priority.  @jgarzik's comments about booting oldest first make a lot of sense for relay nodes which are incapable of perfectly guessing the composite miner transaction inclusion policies, but don't make sense for miners who should boot based on their own inclusion policies.   Also if we combine a floating relay minimum with these other things, we might be able to reach a situation where limiting the mempool is an edge case safety measure.\n",

    "body": "@sipa I'm trying to understand how it makes limiting the mempool harder?  Do you mean that high priority transactions might accidentally be booted?   That's the problem that I'm saying exists regardless.  If you boot by fee, then you might end up with high fee (but for some other reason unlikely to be mined) tx's sticking around in your mempool forever.  If you boot by time, then you might accidentally boot a high fee transaction.  So I feel like we already need to put more thought into how we boot.\n\nBy adjusting the relayfee, I meant on the fly.  Such as in [this idea](https://github.com/morcos/bitcoin/commit/1ff50ca373d8684061b617d9183999e7f1b33251) I got from @petertodd.  The downside of that is that you might mine low fee transactions which made it in your mempool earlier, but reject higher fee transactions that come later.  But I think it might be easier to reason about mempools that have a changing relay cutoff, than mempools that are booting things.  \n",

    "body": "@sipa the overall plan doesn't sound bad, but some points:\nFor #6281 would CTxMemPool::removeOldTransactions work better if we introduce a time index here like morcos proposes?\n\nAlso, I think your third point \"Generalize the feerate here to a unified policy-dependent score (effectively removing the priority as it exists today, as in #6405).\"\nCan be divided in 2:\n1) Replace the pure feerate index with the new unified index.\n2) Stop using feerates and priorities and just use the new unified heuristics (as in #6405)\n\n1 can be done directly in this PR. The new index is first unused, then used for the cap, then for almost anything else, then for block creation too.\nSo CompareTxMemPoolEntryByFee would need to be replaced with something more generic, ideally, compatible with multiple policies. Instead of using CTxMemPoolEntry::GetFeeRate(), we could directly use something like GetTxPriority(const CTransaction&) that can be implemented in policy/policy.cpp [to be later replaced with the method CPolicy::GetTxPriority(const CTransaction&)].\n\nI still don't know how the comparator will get a const reference to a Policy without using the global directly though. But that will only be a problem when we want to turn the function into a method.\n",

The new priority function can return just an integer instead of a double, and it should take const CTransaction& as parameter instead of a CTxMemPoolEntry like CTxMemPoolEntry::GetFeeRate() [as this \"parameter\"] IMO.\n",

I decided that it would be faster for me to communicate with code. Please, let me know what you think about that. Most of the arguments are not used, but they could be useful for some other policies. I believe this is the most policy-flexible thing we can do without disturbing anything.\n",

If it is not done in this PR, it can be done later with a less clean history and more work as additional costs. In terms of git history bike-shedding, this is the perfect time and place to do this, precisely because it's almost free to do so (nothing is depending on the new index yet).\nNote that my 19+7- (compared to the PR, not as a delta(PR, PR+jtimon_nits) which is even smaller) proposal doesn't have any dependencies besides this PR in itself. It is intended to be squashed in this PR or left for later.\nWhat is the disadvantage of squashing my suggestion? \n",
