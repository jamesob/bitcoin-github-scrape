Secondly using up coin days is not just as good a method, because owning coins give you a steady supply of new coin days.\n\nIt's rather obnoxious that I could, for instance, create a timestamping app that made timestamps for free using whatever high-priority coins you had lying around using a bare/p2sh CHECKMULTISIG txout; individually timestamping every single Bitcoin git commit as they were created would only require a BTC or two.\n",

This size is rationally smaller than the size they're willing to create full of free stuff because a lot of free stuff is DOS attack cruft (e.g. the millions of correct horse transactions) or just due to the increased orphaning risk\n\n@jgarzik He's not suggesting we get rid of free transactions, he's suggesting that for the purpose of prioritizing transactions we convert priority into an \"equivalent fee\" and just have one list and no separate free transaction limit.\n",

Converting everything to BTC makes things like artificial priority modifications, perhaps due to an out-of-band fee payment promise or just because the tx one of yours, easier to reason about as well.\n\nAnyway essentially all of this stuff is us saying \"We know the technical limits are 1MB/10minutes, but we know there isn't actually that much genuine blockchain demand yet so we'd rather set artificial limits so we don't waste our startup capital on spam too soon.\" Not to mention that we really want people to get used to the idea that transaction have some kind of cost associated with them, however minor, so apps and business plans aren't written with bad assumptions baked in.\n",

I updated the first commit with your suggestion, and added comments on two places in the code that can be simplified once the network upgrades.\n\n@petertodd : I think you're confused by the code that avoids creating a free transaction with a change output less than 0.01.  The edge case is a user who creates a high-priority transaction (maybe a 10 BTC, well-aged input) with a sub-CENT output (maybe they're sending 0.001 BTC, so have a 9.999 BTC change output) during the transition period when most of the network hasn't upgraded to 0.9 yet. The first version of this pull would send that without a fee, and their transaction would likely never confirm.\n",
